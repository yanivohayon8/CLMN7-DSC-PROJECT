       "'Chapter 3\\n\\nProbability and Information\\nTheory\\n\\nIn this chapter, we describe probability theory and information theory.\\n\\nProbability theory is a mathematical framework for representing uncertain\\nstatements. It provides a means of quantifying uncertainty and axioms for deriving\\nnew uncertain statements. In artiï¬cial intelligence applications, we use probability\\ntheory in two major ways. First, the laws of probability tell us how AI systems\\nshould reason, so we design our algorithms to compute or approximate various\\nexpressions derived using probability theory. Second, we can use probability and\\nstatistics to theoretically analyze the behavior of proposed AI systems.\\n\\nProbability theory is a fundamental tool of many disciplines of science and\\nengineering. We provide this chapter to ensure that readers whose background is\\nprimarily in software engineering with limited exposure to probability theory can\\nunderstand the material in this book.\\n\\nWhile probability theory allows us to make uncertain statements and reason\\nin the presence of uncertainty, information allows us to quantify the amount of\\nuncertainty in a probability distribution.\\n\\nIf you are already familiar with probability theory and information theory,\\nyou may wish to skip all of this chapter except for Sec. 3.14, which describes the\\ngraphs we use to describe structured probabilistic models for machine learning. If\\nyou have absolutely no prior experience with these subjects, this chapter should\\nbe suï¬cient to successfully carry out deep learning research projects, but we do\\nsuggest that you consult an additional resource, such as Jaynes (2003).\\n\\n52\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\n3.1 Why Probability?\\n\\nMany branches of computer science deal mostly with entities that are entirely\\ndeterministic and certain. A programmer can usually safely assume that a CPU will\\nexecute each machine instruction ï¬awlessly. Errors in hardware do occur, but are\\nrare enough that most software applications do not need to be designed to account\\nfor them. Given that many computer scientists and software engineers work in a\\nrelatively clean and certain environment, it can be surprising that machine learning\\nmakes heavy use of probability theory.\\n\\nThis is because machine learning must always deal with uncertain quantities,\\nand sometimes may also need to deal with stochastic (non-deterministic) quantities.\\nUncertainty and stochasticity can arise from many sources. Researchers have made\\ncompelling arguments for quantifying uncertainty using probability since at least\\nthe 1980s. Many of the arguments presented here are summarized from or inspired\\nby Pearl (1988).\\n\\nNearly all activities require some ability to reason in the presence of uncertainty.\\nIn fact, beyond mathematical statements that are true by deï¬nition, it is diï¬cult\\nto think of any proposition that is absolutely true or any event that is absolutely\\nguaranteed to occur.\\n\\nThere are three possible sources of uncertainty:\\n\\n1. Inherent stochasticity in the system being modeled. For example, most\\ninterpretations of quantum mechanics describe the dynamics of subatomic\\nparticles as being probabilistic. We can also create theoretical scenarios that\\nwe postulate to have random dynamics, such as a hypothetical card game\\nwhere we assume that the cards are truly shuï¬ed into a random order.\\n\\n2. Incomplete observability. Even deterministic systems can appear stochastic\\nwhen we cannot observe all of the variables that drive the behavior of the\\nsystem. For example, in the Monty Hall problem, a game show contestant is\\nasked to choose between three doors and wins a prize held behind the chosen\\ndoor. Two doors lead to a goat while a third leads to a car. The outcome\\ngiven the contestantâs choice is deterministic, but from the contestantâs point\\nof view, the outcome is uncertain.\\n\\n3. Incomplete modeling. When we use a model that must discard some of\\nthe information we have observed, the discarded information results in\\nuncertainty in the modelâs predictions. For example, suppose we build a\\nrobot that can exactly observe the location of every object around it. If the\\n\\n53\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nrobot discretizes space when predicting the future location of these objects,\\nthen the discretization makes the robot immediately become uncertain about\\nthe precise position of objects: each object could be anywhere within the\\ndiscrete cell that it was observed to occupy.\\n\\nIn many cases, it is more practical to use a simple but uncertain rule rather\\nthan a complex but certain one, even if the true rule is deterministic and our\\nmodeling system has the ï¬delity to accommodate a complex rule. For example, the\\nsimple rule âMost birds ï¬yâ is cheap to develop and is broadly useful, while a rule\\nof the form, âBirds ï¬y, except for very young birds that have not yet learned to\\nï¬y, sick or injured birds that have lost the ability to ï¬y, ï¬ightless species of birds\\nincluding the cassowary, ostrich and kiwi. . . â is expensive to develop, maintain and\\ncommunicate, and after all of this eï¬ort is still very brittle and prone to failure.\\n\\nGiven that we need a means of representing and reasoning about uncertainty,\\nit is not immediately obvious that probability theory can provide all of the tools\\nwe want for artiï¬cial intelligence applications. Probability theory was originally\\ndeveloped to analyze the frequencies of events. It is easy to see how probability\\ntheory can be used to study events like drawing a certain hand of cards in a\\ngame of poker. These kinds of events are often repeatable. When we say that\\nan outcome has a probability p of occurring, it means that if we repeated the\\nexperiment (e.g., draw a hand of cards) inï¬nitely many times, then proportion p\\nof the repetitions would result in that outcome. This kind of reasoning does not\\nseem immediately applicable to propositions that are not repeatable. If a doctor\\nanalyzes a patient and says that the patient has a 40% chance of having the ï¬u,\\nthis means something very diï¬erentâwe can not make inï¬nitely many replicas of\\nthe patient, nor is there any reason to believe that diï¬erent replicas of the patient\\nwould present with the same symptoms yet have varying underlying conditions. In\\nthe case of the doctor diagnosing the patient, we use probability to represent a\\ndegree of belief, with 1 indicating absolute certainty that the patient has the ï¬u\\nand 0 indicating absolute certainty that the patient does not have the ï¬u. The\\nformer kind of probability, related directly to the rates at which events occur, is\\nknown as frequentist probability, while the latter, related to qualitative levels of\\ncertainty, is known as Bayesian probability.\\n\\nIf we list several properties that we expect common sense reasoning about\\nuncertainty to have, then the only way to satisfy those properties is to treat\\nBayesian probabilities as behaving exactly the same as frequentist probabilities.\\nFor example, if we want to compute the probability that a player will win a poker\\ngame given that she has a certain set of cards, we use exactly the same formulas\\nas when we compute the probability that a patient has a disease given that she\\n\\n54\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nhas certain symptoms. For more details about why a small set of common sense\\nassumptions implies that the same axioms must control both kinds of probability,\\nsee Ramsey (1926).\\n\\nProbability can be seen as the extension of logic to deal with uncertainty. Logic\\nprovides a set of formal rules for determining what propositions are implied to\\nbe true or false given the assumption that some other set of propositions is true\\nor false. Probability theory provides a set of formal rules for determining the\\nlikelihood of a proposition being true given the likelihood of other propositions.\\n\\n3.2 Random Variables\\n\\nA random variable is a variable that can take on diï¬erent values randomly. We\\ntypically denote the random variable itself with a lower case letter in plain typeface,\\nand the values it can take on with lower case script letters. For example, x1 and x2\\nare both possible values that the random variable x can take on. For vector-valued\\nvariables, we would write the random variable as x and one of its values as x. On\\nits own, a random variable is just a description of the states that are possible; it\\nmust be coupled with a probability distribution that speciï¬es how likely each of\\nthese states are.\\n\\nRandom variables may be discrete or continuous. A discrete random variable\\nis one that has a ï¬nite or countably inï¬nite number of states. Note that these\\nstates are not necessarily the integers; they can also just be named states that\\nare not considered to have any numerical value. A continuous random variable is\\nassociated with a real value.\\n\\n3.3 Probability Distributions\\n\\nA probability distribution is a description of how likely a random variable or\\nset of random variables is to take on each of its possible states. The way we\\ndescribe probability distributions depends on whether the variables are discrete or\\ncontinuous.\\n\\n3.3.1 Discrete Variables and Probability Mass Functions\\n\\nA probability distribution over discrete variables may be described using a proba-\\nbility mass function (PMF). We typically denote probability mass functions with a\\ncapital P . Often we associate each random variable with a diï¬erent probability\\n\\n55\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nmass function and the reader must infer which probability mass function to use\\nbased on the identity of the random variable, rather than the name of the function;\\nP\\n\\n( )x is usually not the same as\\n\\n( )y .\\n\\nP\\n\\nThe probability mass function maps from a state of a random variable to\\nthe probability of that random variable taking on that state. The probability\\nthat x = x is denoted as P (x), with a probability of 1 indicating that x = x is\\ncertain and a probability of 0 indicating that x = x is impossible. Sometimes\\nto disambiguate which PMF to use, we write the name of the random variable\\nexplicitly: P (x = x). Sometimes we deï¬ne a variable ï¬rst, then use â¼ notation to\\nspecify which distribution it follows later: x â¼ P (x .)\\n\\nProbability mass functions can act on many variables at the same time. Such\\na probability distribution over many variables is known as a joint probability\\ndistribution. P (x = x, y = y) denotes the probability that x = x and y = y\\nsimultaneously. We may also write\\n\\nfor brevity.\\n\\nP x, y\\n\\n(\\n\\n)\\n\\nTo be a probability mass function on a random variable x, a function P must\\n\\nsatisfy the following properties:\\n\\nP\\n\\nâ¢ The domain of must be the set of all possible states of x.\\nâ¢ âx\\n0 \\n\\n,â x 0 â¤ P (x) â¤ 1. An impossible event has probability and no state can\\nbe less probable than that.

PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\n3.3.2 Continuous Variables and Probability Density Functions\\n\\nWhen working with continuous random variables, we describe probability dis-\\ntributions using a probability density function (PDF) rather than a probability\\nmass function. To be a probability density function, a function p must satisfy the\\nfollowing properties:\\n\\np\\n\\nâ¢ The domain of must be the set of all possible states of x.\\nâ¢ âx\\n\\n0â¥ Note that we do not require ( ) \\np x\\n\\n1â¤ .\\n\\n.\\n\\nâ x ( ) \\n, p x\\n( ) = 1.\\n\\nâ¢ \\ue052 p x dx\\n\\nA probability density function p(x) does not give the probability of a speciï¬c\\nstate directly, instead the probability of landing inside an inï¬nitesimal region with\\nvolume\\n\\nis given by\\n\\np x Î´x\\n\\n( )\\n\\nÎ´x\\n\\n.\\n\\nWe can integrate the density function to ï¬nd the actual probability mass of a\\nset of points. Speciï¬cally, the probability that x lies in some set S is given by the\\nintegral of p(x) over that set. In the univariate example, the probability that x\\nlies in the interval\\n\\nis given by\\n\\n.\\np x dx\\n\\n[\\n]a, b\\n\\n( )\\n\\nFor an example of a probability density function corresponding to a speciï¬c\\nprobability density over a continuous random variable, consider a uniform distribu-\\ntion on an interval of the real numbers. We can do this with a function u (x; a, b),\\nwhere a and b are the endpoints of the interval, with b > a. The â;â notation means\\nâparametrized byâ; we consider x to be the argument of the function, while a and\\nb are parameters that deï¬ne the function. To ensure that there is no probability\\nmass outside the interval, we say u(x; a, b) = 0 for all x \\ue036â [a, b]\\n. Within a, b],\\n. We can see that this is nonnegative everywhere.

The probability\\ndistribution over the subset is known as the marginal probability distribution.\\n\\nFor example, suppose we have discrete random variables x and y , and we know\\n\\nP ,(x y .

PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nThe name âmarginal probabilityâ comes from the process of computing marginal\\nprobabilities on paper. When the values of P(x y, ) are written in a grid with\\ndiï¬erent values of x in rows and diï¬erent values of y in columns, it is natural to\\nsum across a row of the grid, then write P( x) in the margin of the paper just to\\nthe right of the row.\\n\\nFor continuous variables, we need to use integration instead of summation:\\n\\np x( ) =\\ue05a p x, y dy.\\n\\n(\\n\\n)\\n\\n(3.4)\\n\\n3.5 Conditional Probability\\n\\nIn many cases, we are interested in the probability of some event, given that some\\nother event has happened. This is called a conditional probability. We denote\\nthe conditional probability that y = y given x = x as P (y = y | x = x ). This\\nconditional probability can be computed with the formula\\n\\nP\\n\\n( = y\\n\\ny\\n\\n| x =  ) =\\n\\nx\\n\\nP\\n\\n( = y\\n\\ny,\\n\\nx =  )\\nx\\nx\\n)\\n\\nP\\n\\n( = x\\n\\n.\\n\\n(3.5)\\n\\nThe conditional probability is only deï¬ned when P (x = x) > 0. We cannot compute\\nthe conditional probability conditioned on an event that never happens.\\n\\nIt is important not to confuse conditional probability with computing what\\nwould happen if some action were undertaken. The conditional probability that\\na person is from Germany given that they speak German is quite high, but if\\na randomly selected person is taught to speak German, their country of origin\\ndoes not change. Computing the consequences of an action is called making an\\nintervention query. Intervention queries are the domain of causal modeling, which\\nwe do not explore in this book.\\n\\n3.6 The Chain Rule of Conditional Probabilities\\n\\nAny joint probability distribution over many random variables may be decomposed\\ninto conditional distributions over only one variable:\\n\\nP (x(1), . . . , x ( )n ) = \\n\\n| x(1), . . . , x (\\nproduct rule of probability.

For discrete variables this can be computed with a summation:\\n\\nexpected value\\n\\nP\\n\\nExâ¼P[ (f x)] =\\ue058x\\n\\nP x f x ,\\n( ) ( )\\n\\n(3.9)\\n\\nwhile for continuous variables, it is computed with an integral:\\n\\nExâ¼p[ ( )] =\\n\\nf x\\n\\n\\ue05a p x f x dx.\\n\\n( ) ( )\\n\\n59\\n\\n(3.10)\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nWhen the identity of the distribution is clear from the context, we may simply\\nwrite the name of the random variable that the expectation is over, as in Ex[f (x)].\\nIf it is clear which random variable the expectation is over, we may omit the\\nsubscript entirely, as in E[f (x)]. By default, we can assume that E [Â·] averages over\\nthe values of all the random variables inside the brackets. Likewise, when there is\\nno ambiguity, we may omit the square brackets.\\n\\nExpectations are linear, for example,\\n\\nE x[\\n\\nÎ±f x\\n\\n( ) + ( )] = \\n\\nÎ²g x\\n\\nÎ±Ex [ ( )] +\\n\\nf x\\n\\nÎ²Ex[ ( )]\\ng x ,\\n\\n(3.11)\\n\\nwhen\\n\\nÎ±\\n\\nand\\n\\nÎ²\\n\\nare not dependent on .\\nx\\n\\nThe variance gives a measure of how much the values of a function of a random\\nvariable x vary as we sample diï¬erent value of x from its probability distribution:\\n\\nVar( ( )) = \\n\\nf x\\n\\nE\\ue068( ( )\\nf x â E f x 2\\ue069.\\n\\n[ ( )])\\n\\n(3.12)\\n\\nWhen the variance is low, the values of f (x) cluster near their expected value. The\\nsquare root of the variance is known as the standard deviation.\\n\\nThe covariance gives some sense of how much two values are linearly related to\\n\\neach other, as well as the scale of these variables:\\n\\nCov( ( )\\n\\nf x , g y\\n\\n( )) = \\n\\nE f x â E f x\\n[( ( )\\n\\n[ ( )]) ( ( )\\n\\ng y â E g y\\n\\n[ ( )])]\\n\\n.\\n\\n(3.13)\\n\\nHigh absolute values of the covariance mean that the values change very much\\nand are both far from their respective means at the same time. If the sign of the\\ncovariance is positive, then both variables tend to take on relatively high values\\nsimultaneously. If the sign of the covariance is negative, then one variable tends to\\ntake on a relatively high value at the times that the other takes on a relatively low\\nvalue and vice versa. Other measures such as correlation normalize the contribution\\nof each variable in order to measure only how much the variables are related, rather\\nthan also being aï¬ected by the scale of the separate variables.\\n\\nThe notions of covariance and dependence are related, but are in fact distinct\\nconcepts. They are related because two variables that are independent have zero\\ncovariance, and two variables that have non-zero covariance are dependent. How-\\never, independence is a distinct property from covariance. For two variables to have\\nzero covariance, there must be no linear dependence between them. Independence\\nis a stronger requirement than zero covariance, because independence also excludes\\nnonlinear relationships. It is possible for two variables to be dependent but have\\nzero covariance. For example, suppose we ï¬rst sample a real number x from a\\nuniform distribution over the interval [â1 ,1]. We next sample a random variable\\n\\n60\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\ns. With probability 1\\n2, we choose the value of s to be 1.

The multinoulli distribution is\\n\\nor\\n\\n1 âMultinoulliâ is a term that was recently coined by Gustavo Lacerdo and popularized by\\nMurphy (2012). The multinoulli distribution is a special case of the\\ndistribution. A\\nmultinomial distribution is the distribution over vectors in {0, . . . , n}k representing how many\\ntimes each of the k categories is visited when n samples are drawn from a multinoulli distribution.\\nMany texts use the term âmultinomialâ to refer to multinoulli distributions without clarifying\\nthat they refer only to the\\n\\nmultinomial\\n\\nn = 1\\n\\ncase.\\n\\n61\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nparametrized by a vector p â [0, 1]kâ1 , where p i gives the probability of the i-th\\nstate. The ï¬nal, k-th stateâs probability is given by 1â 1\\ue03e p. Note that we must\\nconstrain 1 \\ue03ep â¤ 1. Multinoulli distributions are often used to refer to distributions\\nover categories of objects, so we do not usually assume that state 1 has numerical\\nvalue 1, etc. For this reason, we do not usually need to compute the expectation\\nor variance of multinoulli-distributed random variables.\\n\\nThe Bernoulli and multinoulli distributions are suï¬cient to describe any distri-\\nbution over their domain. This is because they model discrete variables for which\\nit is feasible to simply enumerate all of the states. When dealing with continuous\\nvariables, there are uncountably many states, so any distribution described by a\\nsmall number of parameters must impose strict limits on the distribution.\\n\\n3.9.3 Gaussian Distribution\\n\\nThe most commonly used distribution over real numbers is the normal distribution,\\nalso known as the Gaussian distribution:\\n\\nN ( ;x Âµ, Ï2) =\\ue072 1\\n\\n2ÏÏ2 exp\\ue012â\\n\\n1\\nx\\n2Ï2 (\\n\\nÂµâ 2\\ue013 .\\n\\n)\\n\\n(3.21)\\n\\nSee Fig. 3.1 for a plot of the density function.\\nThe two parameters Âµ â R and Ï â (0,â ) control the normal distribution.\\nThe parameter Âµ gives the coordinate of the central peak. This is also the mean of\\nthe distribution: E[x] = Âµ. The standard deviation of the distribution is given by\\nÏ, and the variance by Ï2.\\n\\nWhen we evaluate the PDF, we need to square and invert Ï. When we need to\\nfrequently evaluate the PDF with diï¬erent parameter values, a more eï¬cient way\\nof parametrizing the distribution is to use a parameter Î² â (0 ,â) to control the\\nprecision or inverse variance of the distribution:\\n\\nN ( ;x Âµ, Î²â1) =\\ue072 Î²\\n\\n2Ï\\n\\nexp\\ue012â\\n\\n1\\n2\\n\\nÎ² x\\n\\n( â )2\\ue013 .\\n\\nÂµ\\n\\n(3.22)\\n\\nNormal distributions are a sensible choice for many applications. In the absence\\nof prior knowledge about what form a distribution over the real numbers should\\ntake, the normal distribution is a good default choice for two major reasons.\\n\\nFirst, many distributions we wish to model are truly close to being normal\\ndistributions. The central limit theorem shows that the sum of many independent\\nrandom variables is approximately normally distributed. This means that in\\n\\n62\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3.

We can thus think of the normal distribution as being the one that\\ninserts the least amount of prior knowledge into a model. Fully developing and\\njustifying this idea requires more mathematical tools, and is postponed to Sec.\\n19.4.2.\\n\\nThe normal distribution generalizes to Rn, in which case it is known as the\\nmultivariate normal distribution.

PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nmany diï¬erent values of the parameters, the covariance is not a computationally\\neï¬cient way to parametrize the distribution, since we need to invert Î£ to evaluate\\nthe PDF.

To accomplish this, we can use the exponential\\ndistribution:\\n\\n(3.25)\\nThe exponential distribution uses the indicator function 1xâ¥0 to assign probability\\nzero to all negative values of\\n\\np x Î»\\n( ; ) =  1xâ¥0exp (\\n\\n)âÎ»x .\\n\\n.x\\n\\nÎ»\\n\\nA closely related probability distribution that allows us to place a sharp peak\\n\\nof probability mass at an arbitrary point\\n\\nÂµ\\n\\nis the\\n\\nLaplace distribution\\n\\nLaplace( ;\\n\\nx Âµ, Î³\\n\\n) =\\n\\n1\\n2Î³\\n\\nexp\\ue012â| â |\\nÎ³ \\ue013.\\n\\nÂµ\\n\\nx\\n\\n(3.26)\\n\\n3.9.5 The Dirac Distribution and Empirical Distribution\\n\\nIn some cases, we wish to specify that all of the mass in a probability distribution\\nclusters around a single point.

The Dirac delta function is not an ordinary function that\\nassociates each value x with a real-valued output, instead it is a diï¬erent kind of\\nmathematical object called a generalized function that is deï¬ned in terms of its\\nproperties when integrated. We can think of the Dirac delta function as being the\\nlimit point of a series of functions that put less and less mass on all points other\\nthan .Âµ\\n\\n64\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nBy deï¬ning p(x) to be Î´ shifted by âÂµ we obtain an inï¬nitely narrow and\\n\\ninï¬nitely high peak of probability mass where\\n\\nx\\n\\nÂµ= \\n\\n.\\n\\nA common use of the Dirac delta distribution is as a component of an empirical\\n\\ndistribution,\\n\\nËp( ) =x\\n\\n1\\nm\\n\\nm\\ue058i=1\\n\\nÎ´(x xâ ( )i )\\n\\n(3.28)\\n\\n1\\nm on each of the m points x(1), . . . , x (\\n\\n)m forming\\nwhich puts probability mass\\na given data set or collection of samples. The Dirac delta distribution is only\\nnecessary to deï¬ne the empirical distribution over continuous variables. For discrete\\nvariables, the situation is simpler: an empirical distribution can be conceptualized\\nas a multinoulli distribution, with a probability associated to each possible input\\nvalue that is simply equal to the empirical frequency of that value in the training\\nset.\\n\\nWe can view the empirical distribution formed from a dataset of training\\nexamples as specifying the distribution that we sample from when we train a model\\non this dataset. Another important perspective on the empirical distribution is\\nthat it is the probability density that maximizes the likelihood of the training\\ndata (see Sec. 5.5). Many machine learning algorithms can be conï¬gured to have\\narbitrarily high capacity. If given enough capacity, these algorithms will simply\\nlearn the empirical distribution. This is a bad outcome because the model does not\\ngeneralize at all and assigns inï¬nitesimal probability to any point in space that did\\nnot occur in the training set. A central problem in machine learning is studying\\nhow to limit the capacity of a model in a way that prevents it from simply learning\\nthe empirical distribution while also allowing it to learn complicated functions.\\n\\n3.9.6 Mixtures of Distributions\\n\\nIt is also common to deï¬ne probability distributions by combining other simpler\\nprobability distributions. One common way of combining distributions is to\\nconstruct a mixture distribution. A mixture distribution is made up of several\\ncomponent distributions. On each trial, the choice of which component distribution\\ngenerates the sample is determined by sampling a component identity from a\\nmultinoulli distribution:\\n\\nP ( ) =x \\ue058i\\n\\nP\\n\\nc\\n( = \\n\\ni P\\n)\\n\\nx c|\\n(\\n\\n=\\n\\ni\\n)\\n\\n(3.29)\\n\\nwhere\\n\\nP ( )\\n\\nc is the multinoulli distribution over component identities.\\n\\n65\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nWe have already seen one example of a mixture distribution: the empirical\\ndistribution over real-valued variables is a mixture distribution with one Dirac\\ncomponent for each training example.\\n\\nThe mixture model is one simple strategy for combining probability distributions\\nto create a richer distribution. In Chapter 16, we explore the art of building complex\\nprobability distributions from simple ones in more detail.\\n\\nlatent variable\\n\\nThe mixture model allows us to brieï¬y glimpse a concept that will be of\\nparamount importance laterâthe\\n. A latent variable is a random\\nvariable that we cannot observe directly. The component identity variable c of the\\nmixture model provides an example. Latent variables may be related to x through\\nthe joint distribution, in this case, P (x c, ) = P (x c|\\n)P(c). The distribution P (c)\\nover the latent variable and the distribution P (x c| ) relating the latent variables\\nto the visible variables determines the shape of the distribution P ( x) even though\\nit is possible to describe P (x) without reference to the latent variable. Latent\\nvariables are discussed further in Sec. 16.5.\\n\\nA very powerful and common type of mixture model is the Gaussian mixture\\nmodel, in which the components p (x | c = i) are Gaussians. Each component has\\na separately parametrized mean Âµ ( )i and covariance Î£ ( )i . Some mixtures can have\\nmore constraints. For example, the covariances could be shared across components\\nvia the constraint Î£( )i = Î£âi. As with a single Gaussian distribution, the mixture\\nof Gaussians might constrain the covariance matrix for each component to be\\ndiagonal or isotropic.\\n\\nIn addition to the means and covariances, the parameters of a Gaussian mixture\\nspecify the prior probability Î± i = P (c = i) given to each component i. The word\\nâpriorâ indicates that it expresses the modelâs beliefs about c before it has observed\\nx. By comparison, P(c | x) is a posterior probability, because it is computed after\\nobservation of x. A Gaussian mixture model is a universal approximator of\\ndensities, in the sense that any smooth density can be approximated with any\\nspeciï¬c, non-zero amount of error by a Gaussian mixture model with enough\\ncomponents.\\n\\nFig. 3.2 shows samples from a Gaussian mixture model.\\n\\n3.10 Useful Properties of Common Functions\\n\\nCertain functions arise often while working with probability distributions, especially\\nthe probability distributions used in deep learning models.\\n\\n66\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\n2\\nx\\n\\nx1\\n\\nFigure 3.2: Samples from a Gaussian mixture model. In this example, there are three\\ncomponents. From left to right, the ï¬rst component has an isotropic covariance matrix,\\nmeaning it has the same amount of variance in each direction. The second has a diagonal\\ncovariane matrix, meaning it can control the variance separately along each axis-aligned\\ndirection. This example has more variance along the x2 axis than along the x1 axis. The\\nthird component has a full-rank covariance matrix, allowing it to control the variance\\nseparately along an abitrary basis of directions.\\n\\nOne of these functions is the logistic sigmoid:\\n\\nÏ x( ) =\\n\\n1\\n\\n1 + exp(\\n\\n.\\n)âx\\n\\n(3.30)\\n\\nThe logistic sigmoid is commonly used to produce the Ï parameter of a Bernoulli\\ndistribution because its range is (0, 1), which lies within the valid range of values\\nfor the Ï parameter. See Fig. 3.3 for a graph of the sigmoid function.

The general version presented here was\\nindependently discovered by Pierre-Simon Laplace.\\n\\n69\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\n3.12 Technical Details of Continuous Variables\\n\\nA proper formal understanding of continuous random variables and probability\\ndensity functions requires developing probability theory in terms of a branch of\\nmathematics known as measure theory. Measure theory is beyond the scope of\\nthis textbook, but we can brieï¬y sketch some of the issues that measure theory is\\nemployed to resolve.\\n\\nIn Sec. 3.3.2, we saw that the probability of a continuous vector-valued x lying\\nin some set S is given by the integral of p(x ) over the set S. Some choices of set S\\ncan produce paradoxes. For example, it is possible to construct two sets S1 and\\nS2 such that p(x â S1) + p(x â S 2) > 1 but S1 â© S2 = â. These sets are generally\\nconstructed making very heavy use of the inï¬nite precision of real numbers, for\\nexample by making fractal-shaped sets or sets that are deï¬ned by transforming\\nthe set of rational numbers2 . One of the key contributions of measure theory is to\\nprovide a characterization of the set of sets that we can compute the probability\\nof without encountering paradoxes. In this book, we only integrate over sets with\\nrelatively simple descriptions, so this aspect of measure theory never becomes a\\nrelevant concern.\\n\\nFor our purposes, measure theory is more useful for describing theorems that\\napply to most points in Rn but do not apply to some corner cases. Measure theory\\nprovides a rigorous way of describing that a set of points is negligibly small. Such\\na set is said to have âmeasure zero.â We do not formally deï¬ne this concept in this\\ntextbook. However, it is useful to understand the intuition that a set of measure\\nzero occupies no volume in the space we are measuring. For example, within R2 , a\\nline has measure zero, while a ï¬lled polygon has positive measure. Likewise, an\\nindividual point has measure zero. Any union of countably many sets that each\\nhave measure zero also has measure zero (so the set of all the rational numbers\\nhas measure zero, for instance).\\n\\nAnother useful term from measure theory is âalmost everywhere.â A property\\nthat holds almost everywhere holds throughout all of space except for on a set of\\nmeasure zero. Because the exceptions occupy a negligible amount of space, they\\ncan be safely ignored for many applications. Some important results in probability\\ntheory hold for all discrete values but only hold âalmost everywhereâ for continuous\\nvalues.\\n\\nAnother technical detail of continuous variables relates to handling continuous\\nrandom variables that are deterministic functions of one another. Suppose we have\\ntwo random variables, x and y, such that y = g(x), where g is an invertible, con-\\n\\n2The Banach-Tarski theorem provides a fun example of such sets.\\n\\n70\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\ntinuous, diï¬erentiable transformation. One might expect that py(y ) =p x(gâ1(y )).\\nThis is actually not the case.\\n\\nAs a simple example, suppose we have scalar random variables x and y. Suppose\\nIf we use the rule p y(y) = p x(2 y) then py will be 0\\non this interval. This means\\n\\ny = x\\neverywhere except the interval [0 , 1\\n2 ]\\n\\n2 and x â¼ U(0,1).\\n\\n, and it will be\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\ue05a py ( ) =\\n\\ny dy\\n\\n1\\n2\\n\\n,\\n\\n(3.43)\\n\\nwhich violates the deï¬nition of a probability distribution.\\n\\nThis common mistake is wrong because it fails to account for the distortion\\nof space introduced by the function g. Recall that the probability of x lying in\\nan inï¬nitesimally small region with volume Î´x is given by p( x)Î´x. Since g can\\nexpand or contract space, the inï¬nitesimal volume surrounding x in x space may\\nhave diï¬erent volume in\\n\\nspace.\\n\\ny\\n\\nTo see how to correct the problem, we return to the scalar case. We need to\\n\\npreserve the property\\n\\nSolving from this, we obtain\\n\\n|py( ( ))\\n\\ng x dy|\\n\\n=\\n\\n|p x( )x dx .|\\n\\nor equivalently\\n\\nIn higher dimensions, the derivative generalizes to the determinant of the Jacobian\\nmatrixâthe matrix with J i,j = âxi\\nâyj\\n\\n.

It was originally invented\\nto study sending messages from discrete alphabets over a noisy channel, such as\\ncommunication via radio transmission. In this context, information theory tells how\\nto design optimal codes and calculate the expected length of messages sampled from\\n\\n71\\n\\n(3.44)\\n\\n(3.45)\\n\\n(3.46)\\n\\n(3.47)\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nspeciï¬c probability distributions using various encoding schemes. In the context of\\nmachine learning, we can also apply information theory to continuous variables\\nwhere some of these message length interpretations do not apply. This ï¬eld is\\nfundamental to many areas of electrical engineering and computer science. In this\\ntextbook, we mostly use a few key ideas from information theory to characterize\\nprobability distributions or quantify similarity between probability distributions.\\nFor more detail on information theory, see Cover and Thomas (2006) or MacKay\\n(2003).\\n\\nThe basic intuition behind information theory is that learning that an unlikely\\nevent has occurred is more informative than learning that a likely event has\\noccurred. A message saying âthe sun rose this morningâ is so uninformative as\\nto be unnecessary to send, but a message saying âthere was a solar eclipse this\\nmorningâ is very informative.\\n\\nWe would like to quantify information in a way that formalizes this intuition.\\n\\nSpeciï¬cally,\\n\\nâ¢ Likely events should have low information content, and in the extreme case,\\nevents that are guaranteed to happen should have no information content\\nwhatsoever.\\n\\nâ¢ Less likely events should have higher information content.\\nâ¢ Independent events should have additive information. For example, ï¬nding\\nout that a tossed coin has come up as heads twice should convey twice as\\nmuch information as ï¬nding out that a tossed coin has come up as heads\\nonce.\\n\\nIn order to satisfy all three of these properties, we deï¬ne the self-information\\n\\nof an event x\\n\\n= x\\n\\nto be\\n\\nI x\\n( ) = \\n\\nlogâ\\n\\nP x .\\n( )\\n\\n(3.48)\\n\\nIn this book, we always use log to mean the natural logarithm, with base e. Our\\ndeï¬nition of I(x) is therefore written in units of\\n. One nat is the amount of\\ninformation gained by observing an event of probability 1\\ne . Other texts use base-2\\nlogarithms and units called\\nshannons\\n; information measured in bits is just\\na rescaling of information measured in nats.\\n\\nnats\\n\\nbits\\n\\nor\\n\\nWhen x is continuous, we use the same deï¬nition of information by analogy,\\nbut some of the properties from the discrete case are lost. For example, an event\\nwith unit density still has zero information, despite not being an event that is\\nguaranteed to occur.\\n\\n72\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3.

The entropy is given by\\nlog . When p is near 0, the distribution\\nis nearly deterministic, because the random variable is nearly always 0. When p is near 1,\\nthe distribution is nearly deterministic, because the random variable is nearly always 1.\\nWhen p = 0 .5, the entropy is maximal, because the distribution is uniform over the two\\noutcomes.\\n\\n(pâ 1) log(1â p )â p\\n\\np\\n\\nSelf-information deals only with a single outcome.

In other words, the Shannon entropy of a distribution is the\\nexpected amount of information in an event drawn from that distribution. It gives\\na lower bound on the number of bits (if the logarithm is base 2, otherwise the units\\nare diï¬erent) needed on average to encode symbols drawn from a distribution P.\\nDistributions that are nearly deterministic (where the outcome is nearly certain)\\nhave low entropy; distributions that are closer to uniform have high entropy. See\\nFig. 3.5 for a demonstration. When x is continous, the Shannon entropy is known\\nas the diï¬erential entropy.\\n\\nIf we have two separate probability distributions P(x) and Q(x) over the same\\nrandom variable x, we can measure how diï¬erent these two distributions are using\\nthe Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence:\\n\\nDKL(\\n\\nP Q\\ue06b\\n\\n) = \\n\\nE xâ¼P\\ue014log\\n\\nP x( )\\n\\nQ x( )\\ue015 = Exâ¼P [log ( )\\n\\nP x â\\n\\n73\\n\\nlog ( )]\\nQ x .\\n\\n(3.50)\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nIn the case of discrete variables, it is the extra amount of information (measured\\nin bits if we use the base\\nlogarithm, but in machine learning we usually use nats\\nand the natural logarithm) needed to send a message containing symbols drawn\\nfrom probability distribution P , when we use a code that was designed to minimize\\nthe length of messages drawn from probability distribution\\n\\n.Q\\n\\n2\\n\\nThe KL divergence has many useful properties, most notably that it is non-\\nnegative. The KL divergence is 0 if and only if P and Qare the same distribution in\\nthe case of discrete variables, or equal âalmost everywhereâ in the case of continuous\\nvariables. Because the KL divergence is non-negative and measures the diï¬erence\\nbetween two distributions, it is often conceptualized as measuring some sort of\\ndistance between these distributions. However, it is not a true distance measure\\nbecause it is not symmetric: DKL(P Q\\ue06b ) \\ue036= DKL( Q P\\ue06b ) for some P and Q. This\\nasymmetry means that there are important consequences to the choice of whether\\nto use DKL(\\n\\n. See Fig. 3.6 for more detail.\\n\\nor DKL (\\n\\n)\\n\\nP Q\\ue06b\\n\\n)Q P\\ue06b\\n\\nA quantity that is closely related to the KL divergence is the cross-entropy\\nH (P, Q ) = H (P) + DKL(P Q\\ue06b ), which is similar to the KL divergence but lacking\\nthe term on the left:\\n(3.51)\\n\\nH P, Q(\\n\\n) = âE\\n\\nxâ¼P log ( )Q x .\\n\\nMinimizing the cross-entropy with respect to Q is equivalent to minimizing the\\nKL divergence, because\\n\\ndoes not participate in the omitted term.\\n\\nQ\\n\\nWhen computing many of these quantities, it is common to encounter expres-\\nsions of the form 0log 0. By convention, in the context of information theory, we\\ntreat these expressions as limxâ0 x\\n\\nlog = 0.\\n\\nx\\n\\n3.14 Structured Probabilistic Models\\n\\nMachine learning algorithms often involve probability distributions over a very\\nlarge number of random variables. Often, these probability distributions involve\\ndirect interactions between relatively few variables. Using a single function to\\ndescribe the entire joint probability distribution can be very ineï¬cient (both\\ncomputationally and statistically).\\n\\nInstead of using a single function to represent a probability distribution, we\\ncan split a probability distribution into many factors that we multiply together.\\nFor example, suppose we have three random variables: a, b and c . Suppose that\\na inï¬uences the value of b and b inï¬uences the value of c, but that a and c are\\nindependent given b. We can represent the probability distribution over all three\\n\\n74\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3.

Suppose we have a distribution p(x ) and\\nwish to approximate it with another distribution q(x). We have the choice of minimizing\\neither DKL( p q\\ue06b ) or DKL( q p\\ue06b ). We illustrate the eï¬ect of this choice using a mixture of\\ntwo Gaussians for p, and a single Gaussian for q. The choice of which direction of the\\nKL divergence to use is problem-dependent. Some applications require an approximation\\nthat usually places high probability anywhere that the true distribution places high\\nprobability, while other applications require an approximation that rarely places high\\nprobability anywhere that the true distribution places low probability. The choice of the\\ndirection of the KL divergence reï¬ects which of these considerations takes priority for each\\napplication. (Left) The eï¬ect of minimizing DKL (p q\\ue06b ). In this case, we select a q that has\\nhigh probability where p has high probability. When p has multiple modes, q chooses to\\nblur the modes together, in order to put high probability mass on all of them. (Right) The\\neï¬ect of minimizing DKL (q p\\ue06b ). In this case, we select a q that has low probability where\\np has low probability. When p has multiple modes that are suï¬ciently widely separated,\\nas in this ï¬gure, the KL divergence is minimized by choosing a single mode, in order to\\navoid putting probability mass in the low-probability areas between modes of p . Here, we\\nillustrate the outcome when q is chosen to emphasize the left mode. We could also have\\nachieved an equal value of the KL divergence by choosing the right mode. If the modes\\nare not separated by a suï¬ciently strong low probability region, then this direction of the\\nKL divergence can still choose to blur the modes.\\n\\n75\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3.

Each factor uses a number of parameters that is\\nexponential in the number of variables in the factor. This means that we can greatly\\nreduce the cost of representing a distribution if we are able to ï¬nd a factorization\\ninto distributions over fewer variables.\\n\\nWe can describe these kinds of factorizations using graphs. Here we use the\\nword âgraphâ in the sense of graph theory: a set of vertices that may be connected\\nto each other with edges. When we represent the factorization of a probability\\ndistribution with a graph, we call it a structured probabilistic model\\ngraphical\\nmodel.\\n\\nor\\n\\nThere are two main kinds of structured probabilistic models: directed and\\nundirected. Both kinds of graphical models use a graph G in which each node\\nin the graph corresponds to a random variable, and an edge connecting two\\nrandom variables means that the probability distribution is able to represent direct\\ninteractions between those two random variables.\\n\\nDirected models use graphs with directed edges, and they represent factoriza-\\ntions into conditional probability distributions, as in the example above. Speciï¬cally,\\na directed model contains one factor for every random variable x i in the distribution,\\nand that factor consists of the conditional distribution over xi given the parents of\\nxi, denoted P a G(x i):\\n\\n(3.53)\\n\\np( ) =x \\ue059i\\n\\np (xi | P aG (xi )) .\\n\\nSee Fig. 3.7 for an example of a directed graph and the factorization of probability\\ndistributions it represents.\\n\\nUndirected models use graphs with undirected edges, and they represent fac-\\ntorizations into a set of functions; unlike in the directed case, these functions are\\nusually not probability distributions of any kind. Any set of nodes that are all\\nconnected to each other in G is called a clique. Each clique C ( )i\\nin an undirected\\nmodel is associated with a factor Ï( )i (C ( )i ). These factors are just functions, not\\nprobability distributions. The output of each factor must be non-negative, but\\nthere is no constraint that the factor must sum or integrate to 1 like a probability\\ndistribution.\\n\\nThe probability of a conï¬guration of random variables is proportional to the\\nproduct of all of these factorsâassignments that result in larger factor values are\\n\\n76\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3.

      "\n",
      "Many branches of computer science deal mostly with entities that are entirely\n",
      "deterministic and certain. A programmer can usually safely assume that a CPU will\n",
      "execute each machine instruction ï¬awlessly. Errors in hardware do occur, but are\n",
      "rare enough that most software applications do not need to be designed to account\n",
      "for them. Given that many computer scientists and software engineers work in a\n",
      "relatively clean and certain environment, it can be surprising that machine learning\n",
      "makes heavy use of probability theory.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is because machine learning must always deal with uncertain quantities,\n",
      "and sometimes may also need to deal with stochastic (non-deterministic) quantities.\n",
      "Uncertainty and stochasticity can arise from many sources. Researchers have made\n",
      "compelling arguments for quantifying uncertainty using probability since at least\n",
      "the 1980s. Many of the arguments presented here are summarized from or inspired\n",
      "by Pearl (1988).\n",
      "\n",
      "Nearly all activities require some ability to reason in the presence of uncertainty.\n",
      "In fact, beyond mathematical statements that are true by deï¬nition, it is diï¬cult\n",
      "to think of any proposition that is absolutely true or any event that is absolutely\n",
      "guaranteed to occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are three possible sources of uncertainty:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Inherent stochasticity in the system being modeled. For example, most\n",
      "interpretations of quantum mechanics describe the dynamics of subatomic\n",
      "particles as being probabilistic. We can also create theoretical scenarios that\n",
      "we postulate to have random dynamics, such as a hypothetical card game\n",
      "where we assume that the cards are truly shuï¬ed into a random order.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Incomplete observability. Even deterministic systems can appear stochastic\n",
      "when we cannot observe all of the variables that drive the behavior of the\n",
      "system. For example, in the Monty Hall problem, a game show contestant is\n",
      "asked to choose between three doors and wins a prize held behind the chosen\n",
      "door. Two doors lead to a goat while a third leads to a car. The outcome\n",
      "given the contestantâs choice is deterministic, but from the contestantâs point\n",
      "of view, the outcome is uncertain.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Incomplete modeling. When we use a model that must discard some of\n",
      "the information we have observed, the discarded information results in\n",
      "uncertainty in the modelâs predictions. For example, suppose we build a\n",
      "robot that can exactly observe the location of every object around it. If the\n",

      "the precise position of objects: each object could be anywhere within the\n",
      "discrete cell that it was observed to occupy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In many cases, it is more practical to use a simple but uncertain rule rather\n",
      "than a complex but certain one, even if the true rule is deterministic and our\n",
      "modeling system has the ï¬delity to accommodate a complex rule. For example, the\n",

      "communicate, and after all of this eï¬ort is still very brittle and prone to failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that we need a means of representing and reasoning about uncertainty,\n",
      "it is not immediately obvious that probability theory can provide all of the tools\n",
      "we want for artiï¬cial intelligence applications. Probability theory was originally\n",
      "developed to analyze the frequencies of events. It is easy to see how probability\n",
      "theory can be used to study events like drawing a certain hand of cards in a\n",
      "game of poker. These kinds of events are often repeatable. When we say that\n",
      "an outcome has a probability p of occurring, it means that if we repeated the\n",
      "experiment (e.g., draw a hand of cards) inï¬nitely many times, then proportion p\n",
      "of the repetitions would result in that outcome. This kind of reasoning does not\n",
      "seem immediately applicable to propositions that are not repeatable. If a doctor\n",
      "analyzes a patient and says that the patient has a 40% chance of having the ï¬u,\n",
      "this means something very diï¬erentâwe can not make inï¬nitely many replicas of\n",

      "would present with the same symptoms yet have varying underlying conditions. In\n",

      "degree of belief, with 1 indicating absolute certainty that the patient has the ï¬u\n",

      "\n",
      "In Sec. 3.3.2, we saw that the probability of a continuous vector-valued x lying\n",
      "in some set S is given by the integral of p(x ) over the set S. Some choices of set S\n",
      "can produce paradoxes. For example, it is possible to construct two sets S1 and\n",
      "S2 such that p(x â S1) + p(x â S 2) > 1 but S1 â© S2 = â. These sets are generally\n",

      "example by making fractal-shaped sets or sets that are deï¬ned by transforming\n",
      "the set of rational numbers2 . One of the key contributions of measure theory is to\n",
      "provide a characterization of the set of sets that we can compute the probability\n",
      "of without encountering paradoxes. In this book, we only integrate over sets with\n",
      "relatively simple descriptions, so this aspect of measure theory never becomes a\n",
      "relevant concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "For our purposes, measure theory is more useful for describing theorems that\n",
      "apply to most points in Rn but do not apply to some corner cases. Measure theory\n",
      "provides a rigorous way of describing that a set of points is negligibly small. Such\n",
      "a set is said to have âmeasure zero.â We do not formally deï¬ne this concept in this\n",
      "textbook. However, it is useful to understand the intuition that a set of measure\n",
      "zero occupies no volume in the space we are measuring. For example, within R2 , a\n",
      "line has measure zero, while a ï¬lled polygon has positive measure. Likewise, an\n",
      "individual point has measure zero. Any union of countably many sets that each\n",
      "have measure zero also has measure zero (so the set of all the rational numbers\n",
      "has measure zero, for instance).\n",
      "\n",
      "Another useful term from measure theory is âalmost everywhere.â A property\n",

       "'Chapter 3\\n\\nProbability and Information\\nTheory\\n\\nIn this chapter, we describe probability theory and information theory.\\n\\nProbability theory is a mathematical framework for representing uncertain\\nstatements. It provides a means of quantifying uncertainty and axioms for deriving\\nnew uncertain statements. In artiï¬cial intelligence applications, we use probability\\ntheory in two major ways. First, the laws of probability tell us how AI systems\\nshould reason, so we design our algorithms to compute or approximate various\\nexpressions derived using probability theory. Second, we can use probability and\\nstatistics to theoretically analyze the behavior of proposed AI systems.\\n\\nProbability theory is a fundamental tool of many disciplines of science and\\nengineering. We provide this chapter to ensure that readers whose background is\\nprimarily in software engineering with limited exposure to probability theory can\\nunderstand the material in this book.\\n\\nWhile probability theory allows us to make uncertain statements and reason\\nin the presence of uncertainty, information allows us to quantify the amount of\\nuncertainty in a probability distribution.\\n\\nIf you are already familiar with probability theory and information theory,\\nyou may wish to skip all of this chapter except for Sec. 3.14, which describes the\\ngraphs we use to describe structured probabilistic models for machine learning. If\\nyou have absolutely no prior experience with these subjects, this chapter should\\nbe suï¬cient to successfully carry out deep learning research projects, but we do\\nsuggest that you consult an additional resource, such as Jaynes (2003).\\n\\n52\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\n3.1 Why Probability?\\n\\nMany branches of computer science deal mostly with entities that are entirely\\ndeterministic and certain. A programmer can usually safely assume that a CPU will\\nexecute each machine instruction ï¬awlessly. Errors in hardware do occur, but are\\nrare enough that most software applications do not need to be designed to account\\nfor them. Given that many computer scientists and software engineers work in a\\nrelatively clean and certain environment, it can be surprising that machine learning\\nmakes heavy use of probability theory.\\n\\nThis is because machine learning must always deal with uncertain quantities,\\nand sometimes may also need to deal with stochastic (non-deterministic) quantities.\\nUncertainty and stochasticity can arise from many sources. Researchers have made\\ncompelling arguments for quantifying uncertainty using probability since at least\\nthe 1980s. Many of the arguments presented here are summarized from or inspired\\nby Pearl (1988).\\n\\nNearly all activities require some ability to reason in the presence of uncertainty.\\nIn fact, beyond mathematical statements that are true by deï¬nition, it is diï¬cult\\nto think of any proposition that is absolutely true or any event that is absolutely\\nguaranteed to occur.\\n\\nThere are three possible sources of uncertainty:\\n\\n1. Inherent stochasticity in the system being modeled. For example, most\\ninterpretations of quantum mechanics describe the dynamics of subatomic\\nparticles as being probabilistic. We can also create theoretical scenarios that\\nwe postulate to have random dynamics, such as a hypothetical card game\\nwhere we assume that the cards are truly shuï¬ed into a random order.\\n\\n2. Incomplete observability. Even deterministic systems can appear stochastic\\nwhen we cannot observe all of the variables that drive the behavior of the\\nsystem. For example, in the Monty Hall problem, a game show contestant is\\nasked to choose between three doors and wins a prize held behind the chosen\\ndoor. Two doors lead to a goat while a third leads to a car. The outcome\\ngiven the contestantâs choice is deterministic, but from the contestantâs point\\nof view, the outcome is uncertain.\\n\\n3. Incomplete modeling. When we use a model that must discard some of\\nthe information we have observed, the discarded information results in\\nuncertainty in the modelâs predictions. For example, suppose we build a\\nrobot that can exactly observe the location of every object around it. If the\\n\\n53\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nrobot discretizes space when predicting the future location of these objects,\\nthen the discretization makes the robot immediately become uncertain about\\nthe precise position of objects: each object could be anywhere within the\\ndiscrete cell that it was observed to occupy.\\n\\nIn many cases, it is more practical to use a simple but uncertain rule rather\\nthan a complex but certain one, even if the true rule is deterministic and our\\nmodeling system has the ï¬delity to accommodate a complex rule. For example, the\\nsimple rule âMost birds ï¬yâ is cheap to develop and is broadly useful, while a rule\\nof the form, âBirds ï¬y, except for very young birds that have not yet learned to\\nï¬y, sick or injured birds that have lost the ability to ï¬y, ï¬ightless species of birds\\nincluding the cassowary, ostrich and kiwi. . . â is expensive to develop, maintain and\\ncommunicate, and after all of this eï¬ort is still very brittle and prone to failure.\\n\\nGiven that we need a means of representing and reasoning about uncertainty,\\nit is not immediately obvious that probability theory can provide all of the tools\\nwe want for artiï¬cial intelligence applications. Probability theory was originally\\ndeveloped to analyze the frequencies of events. It is easy to see how probability\\ntheory can be used to study events like drawing a certain hand of cards in a\\ngame of poker. These kinds of events are often repeatable. When we say that\\nan outcome has a probability p of occurring, it means that if we repeated the\\nexperiment (e.g., draw a hand of cards) inï¬nitely many times, then proportion p\\nof the repetitions would result in that outcome. This kind of reasoning does not\\nseem immediately applicable to propositions that are not repeatable. If a doctor\\nanalyzes a patient and says that the patient has a 40% chance of having the ï¬u,\\nthis means something very diï¬erentâwe can not make inï¬nitely many replicas of\\nthe patient, nor is there any reason to believe that diï¬erent replicas of the patient\\nwould present with the same symptoms yet have varying underlying conditions. In\\nthe case of the doctor diagnosing the patient, we use probability to represent a\\ndegree of belief, with 1 indicating absolute certainty that the patient has the ï¬u\\nand 0 indicating absolute certainty that the patient does not have the ï¬u. The\\nformer kind of probability, related directly to the rates at which events occur, is\\nknown as frequentist probability, while the latter, related to qualitative levels of\\ncertainty, is known as Bayesian probability.\\n\\nIf we list several properties that we expect common sense reasoning about\\nuncertainty to have, then the only way to satisfy those properties is to treat\\nBayesian probabilities as behaving exactly the same as frequentist probabilities.\\nFor example, if we want to compute the probability that a player will win a poker\\ngame given that she has a certain set of cards, we use exactly the same formulas\\nas when we compute the probability that a patient has a disease given that she\\n\\n54\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nhas certain symptoms. For more details about why a small set of common sense\\nassumptions implies that the same axioms must control both kinds of probability,\\nsee Ramsey (1926).\\n\\nProbability can be seen as the extension of logic to deal with uncertainty. Logic\\nprovides a set of formal rules for determining what propositions are implied to\\nbe true or false given the assumption that some other set of propositions is true\\nor false. Probability theory provides a set of formal rules for determining the\\nlikelihood of a proposition being true given the likelihood of other propositions.\\n\\n3.2 Random Variables\\n\\nA random variable is a variable that can take on diï¬erent values randomly. We\\ntypically denote the random variable itself with a lower case letter in plain typeface,\\nand the values it can take on with lower case script letters. For example, x1 and x2\\nare both possible values that the random variable x can take on. For vector-valued\\nvariables, we would write the random variable as x and one of its values as x. On\\nits own, a random variable is just a description of the states that are possible; it\\nmust be coupled with a probability distribution that speciï¬es how likely each of\\nthese states are.\\n\\nRandom variables may be discrete or continuous. A discrete random variable\\nis one that has a ï¬nite or countably inï¬nite number of states. Note that these\\nstates are not necessarily the integers; they can also just be named states that\\nare not considered to have any numerical value. A continuous random variable is\\nassociated with a real value.\\n\\n3.3 Probability Distributions\\n\\nA probability distribution is a description of how likely a random variable or\\nset of random variables is to take on each of its possible states. The way we\\ndescribe probability distributions depends on whether the variables are discrete or\\ncontinuous.\\n\\n3.3.1 Discrete Variables and Probability Mass Functions\\n\\nA probability distribution over discrete variables may be described using a proba-\\nbility mass function (PMF). We typically denote probability mass functions with a\\ncapital P . Often we associate each random variable with a diï¬erent probability\\n\\n55\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nmass function and the reader must infer which probability mass function to use\\nbased on the identity of the random variable, rather than the name of the function;\\nP\\n\\n( )x is usually not the same as\\n\\n( )y .\\n\\nP\\n\\nThe probability mass function maps from a state of a random variable to\\nthe probability of that random variable taking on that state. The probability\\nthat x = x is denoted as P (x), with a probability of 1 indicating that x = x is\\ncertain and a probability of 0 indicating that x = x is impossible. Sometimes\\nto disambiguate which PMF to use, we write the name of the random variable\\nexplicitly: P (x = x). Sometimes we deï¬ne a variable ï¬rst, then use â¼ notation to\\nspecify which distribution it follows later: x â¼ P (x .)\\n\\nProbability mass functions can act on many variables at the same time. Such\\na probability distribution over many variables is known as a joint probability\\ndistribution. P (x = x, y = y) denotes the probability that x = x and y = y\\nsimultaneously. We may also write\\n\\nfor brevity.\\n\\nP x, y\\n\\n(\\n\\n)\\n\\nTo be a probability mass function on a random variable x, a function P must\\n\\nsatisfy the following properties:\\n\\nP\\n\\nâ¢ The domain of must be the set of all possible states of x.\\nâ¢ âx\\n0 \\n\\n,â x 0 â¤ P (x) â¤ 1.

PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\n3.3.2 Continuous Variables and Probability Density Functions\\n\\nWhen working with continuous random variables, we describe probability dis-\\ntributions using a probability density function (PDF) rather than a probability\\nmass function. To be a probability density function, a function p must satisfy the\\nfollowing properties:\\n\\np\\n\\nâ¢ The domain of must be the set of all possible states of x.\\nâ¢ âx\\n\\n0â¥ Note that we do not require ( ) \\np x\\n\\n1â¤ .\\n\\n.\\n\\nâ x ( ) \\n, p x\\n( ) = 1.\\n\\nâ¢ \\ue052 p x dx\\n\\nA probability density function p(x) does not give the probability of a speciï¬c\\nstate directly, instead the probability of landing inside an inï¬nitesimal region with\\nvolume\\n\\nis given by\\n\\np x Î´x\\n\\n( )\\n\\nÎ´x\\n\\n.\\n\\nWe can integrate the density function to ï¬nd the actual probability mass of a\\nset of points. Speciï¬cally, the probability that x lies in some set S is given by the\\nintegral of p(x) over that set. In the univariate example, the probability that x\\nlies in the interval\\n\\nis given by\\n\\n.\\np x dx\\n\\n[\\n]a, b\\n\\n( )\\n\\nFor an example of a probability density function corresponding to a speciï¬c\\nprobability density over a continuous random variable, consider a uniform distribu-\\ntion on an interval of the real numbers. We can do this with a function u (x; a, b),\\nwhere a and b are the endpoints of the interval, with b > a. The â;â notation means\\nâparametrized byâ; we consider x to be the argument of the function, while a and\\nb are parameters that deï¬ne the function. To ensure that there is no probability\\nmass outside the interval, we say u(x; a, b) = 0 for all x \\ue036â [a, b]\\n. Within a, b],\\n. We can see that this is nonnegative everywhere. Additionally, it\\nu x a, b\\n( ;\\nintegrates to 1.

The probability\\ndistribution over the subset is known as the marginal probability distribution.\\n\\nFor example, suppose we have discrete random variables x and y , and we know\\n\\nP ,(x y .

PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nThe name âmarginal probabilityâ comes from the process of computing marginal\\nprobabilities on paper. When the values of P(x y, ) are written in a grid with\\ndiï¬erent values of x in rows and diï¬erent values of y in columns, it is natural to\\nsum across a row of the grid, then write P( x) in the margin of the paper just to\\nthe right of the row.\\n\\nFor continuous variables, we need to use integration instead of summation:\\n\\np x( ) =\\ue05a p x, y dy.\\n\\n(\\n\\n)\\n\\n(3.4)\\n\\n3.5 Conditional Probability\\n\\nIn many cases, we are interested in the probability of some event, given that some\\nother event has happened. This is called a conditional probability. We denote\\nthe conditional probability that y = y given x = x as P (y = y | x = x ). This\\nconditional probability can be computed with the formula\\n\\nP\\n\\n( = y\\n\\ny\\n\\n| x =  ) =\\n\\nx\\n\\nP\\n\\n( = y\\n\\ny,\\n\\nx =  )\\nx\\nx\\n)\\n\\nP\\n\\n( = x\\n\\n.\\n\\n(3.5)\\n\\nThe conditional probability is only deï¬ned when P (x = x) > 0. We cannot compute\\nthe conditional probability conditioned on an event that never happens.\\n\\nIt is important not to confuse conditional probability with computing what\\nwould happen if some action were undertaken. The conditional probability that\\na person is from Germany given that they speak German is quite high, but if\\na randomly selected person is taught to speak German, their country of origin\\ndoes not change. Computing the consequences of an action is called making an\\nintervention query. Intervention queries are the domain of causal modeling, which\\nwe do not explore in this book.\\n\\n3.6 The Chain Rule of Conditional Probabilities\\n\\nAny joint probability distribution over many random variables may be decomposed\\ninto conditional distributions over only one variable:\\n\\nP (x(1), . . . , x ( )n ) = \\n\\n| x(1), . . . , x (\\nproduct rule of probability.

For discrete variables this can be computed with a summation:\\n\\nexpected value\\n\\nP\\n\\nExâ¼P[ (f x)] =\\ue058x\\n\\nP x f x ,\\n( ) ( )\\n\\n(3.9)\\n\\nwhile for continuous variables, it is computed with an integral:\\n\\nExâ¼p[ ( )] =\\n\\nf x\\n\\n\\ue05a p x f x dx.\\n\\n( ) ( )\\n\\n59\\n\\n(3.10)\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nWhen the identity of the distribution is clear from the context, we may simply\\nwrite the name of the random variable that the expectation is over, as in Ex[f (x)].\\nIf it is clear which random variable the expectation is over, we may omit the\\nsubscript entirely, as in E[f (x)]. By default, we can assume that E [Â·] averages over\\nthe values of all the random variables inside the brackets. Likewise, when there is\\nno ambiguity, we may omit the square brackets.\\n\\nExpectations are linear, for example,\\n\\nE x[\\n\\nÎ±f x\\n\\n( ) + ( )] = \\n\\nÎ²g x\\n\\nÎ±Ex [ ( )] +\\n\\nf x\\n\\nÎ²Ex[ ( )]\\ng x ,\\n\\n(3.11)\\n\\nwhen\\n\\nÎ±\\n\\nand\\n\\nÎ²\\n\\nare not dependent on .\\nx\\n\\nThe variance gives a measure of how much the values of a function of a random\\nvariable x vary as we sample diï¬erent value of x from its probability distribution:\\n\\nVar( ( )) = \\n\\nf x\\n\\nE\\ue068( ( )\\nf x â E f x 2\\ue069.\\n\\n[ ( )])\\n\\n(3.12)\\n\\nWhen the variance is low, the values of f (x) cluster near their expected value. The\\nsquare root of the variance is known as the standard deviation.\\n\\nThe covariance gives some sense of how much two values are linearly related to\\n\\neach other, as well as the scale of these variables:\\n\\nCov( ( )\\n\\nf x , g y\\n\\n( )) = \\n\\nE f x â E f x\\n[( ( )\\n\\n[ ( )]) ( ( )\\n\\ng y â E g y\\n\\n[ ( )])]\\n\\n.\\n\\n(3.13)\\n\\nHigh absolute values of the covariance mean that the values change very much\\nand are both far from their respective means at the same time. If the sign of the\\ncovariance is positive, then both variables tend to take on relatively high values\\nsimultaneously. If the sign of the covariance is negative, then one variable tends to\\ntake on a relatively high value at the times that the other takes on a relatively low\\nvalue and vice versa. Other measures such as correlation normalize the contribution\\nof each variable in order to measure only how much the variables are related, rather\\nthan also being aï¬ected by the scale of the separate variables.\\n\\nThe notions of covariance and dependence are related, but are in fact distinct\\nconcepts. They are related because two variables that are independent have zero\\ncovariance, and two variables that have non-zero covariance are dependent. How-\\never, independence is a distinct property from covariance. For two variables to have\\nzero covariance, there must be no linear dependence between them. Independence\\nis a stronger requirement than zero covariance, because independence also excludes\\nnonlinear relationships. It is possible for two variables to be dependent but have\\nzero covariance. For example, suppose we ï¬rst sample a real number x from a\\nuniform distribution over the interval [â1 ,1]. We next sample a random variable\\n\\n60\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\ns. With probability 1\\n2, we choose the value of s to be 1. Otherwise, we choose\\nthe value of s to be â 1. We can then generate a random variable y by assigning\\ny = sx .

The multinoulli distribution is\\n\\nor\\n\\n1 âMultinoulliâ is a term that was recently coined by Gustavo Lacerdo and popularized by\\nMurphy (2012). The multinoulli distribution is a special case of the\\ndistribution. A\\nmultinomial distribution is the distribution over vectors in {0, . . . , n}k representing how many\\ntimes each of the k categories is visited when n samples are drawn from a multinoulli distribution.\\nMany texts use the term âmultinomialâ to refer to multinoulli distributions without clarifying\\nthat they refer only to the\\n\\nmultinomial\\n\\nn = 1\\n\\ncase.\\n\\n61\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nparametrized by a vector p â [0, 1]kâ1 , where p i gives the probability of the i-th\\nstate. The ï¬nal, k-th stateâs probability is given by 1â 1\\ue03e p. Note that we must\\nconstrain 1 \\ue03ep â¤ 1. Multinoulli distributions are often used to refer to distributions\\nover categories of objects, so we do not usually assume that state 1 has numerical\\nvalue 1, etc. For this reason, we do not usually need to compute the expectation\\nor variance of multinoulli-distributed random variables.\\n\\nThe Bernoulli and multinoulli distributions are suï¬cient to describe any distri-\\nbution over their domain. This is because they model discrete variables for which\\nit is feasible to simply enumerate all of the states. When dealing with continuous\\nvariables, there are uncountably many states, so any distribution described by a\\nsmall number of parameters must impose strict limits on the distribution.\\n\\n3.9.3 Gaussian Distribution\\n\\nThe most commonly used distribution over real numbers is the normal distribution,\\nalso known as the Gaussian distribution:\\n\\nN ( ;x Âµ, Ï2) =\\ue072 1\\n\\n2ÏÏ2 exp\\ue012â\\n\\n1\\nx\\n2Ï2 (\\n\\nÂµâ 2\\ue013 .\\n\\n)\\n\\n(3.21)\\n\\nSee Fig. 3.1 for a plot of the density function.\\nThe two parameters Âµ â R and Ï â (0,â ) control the normal distribution.\\nThe parameter Âµ gives the coordinate of the central peak. This is also the mean of\\nthe distribution: E[x] = Âµ. The standard deviation of the distribution is given by\\nÏ, and the variance by Ï2.\\n\\nWhen we evaluate the PDF, we need to square and invert Ï. When we need to\\nfrequently evaluate the PDF with diï¬erent parameter values, a more eï¬cient way\\nof parametrizing the distribution is to use a parameter Î² â (0 ,â) to control the\\nprecision or inverse variance of the distribution:\\n\\nN ( ;x Âµ, Î²â1) =\\ue072 Î²\\n\\n2Ï\\n\\nexp\\ue012â\\n\\n1\\n2\\n\\nÎ² x\\n\\n( â )2\\ue013 .\\n\\nÂµ\\n\\n(3.22)\\n\\nNormal distributions are a sensible choice for many applications. In the absence\\nof prior knowledge about what form a distribution over the real numbers should\\ntake, the normal distribution is a good default choice for two major reasons.\\n\\nFirst, many distributions we wish to model are truly close to being normal\\ndistributions. The central limit theorem shows that the sum of many independent\\nrandom variables is approximately normally distributed. This means that in\\n\\n62\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3.

We can thus think of the normal distribution as being the one that\\ninserts the least amount of prior knowledge into a model. Fully developing and\\njustifying this idea requires more mathematical tools, and is postponed to Sec.\\n19.4.2.\\n\\nThe normal distribution generalizes to Rn, in which case it is known as the\\nmultivariate normal distribution.

PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nmany diï¬erent values of the parameters, the covariance is not a computationally\\neï¬cient way to parametrize the distribution, since we need to invert Î£ to evaluate\\nthe PDF.

The Dirac delta function is not an ordinary function that\\nassociates each value x with a real-valued output, instead it is a diï¬erent kind of\\nmathematical object called a generalized function that is deï¬ned in terms of its\\nproperties when integrated. We can think of the Dirac delta function as being the\\nlimit point of a series of functions that put less and less mass on all points other\\nthan .Âµ\\n\\n64\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nBy deï¬ning p(x) to be Î´ shifted by âÂµ we obtain an inï¬nitely narrow and\\n\\ninï¬nitely high peak of probability mass where\\n\\nx\\n\\nÂµ= \\n\\n.\\n\\nA common use of the Dirac delta distribution is as a component of an empirical\\n\\ndistribution,\\n\\nËp( ) =x\\n\\n1\\nm\\n\\nm\\ue058i=1\\n\\nÎ´(x xâ ( )i )\\n\\n(3.28)\\n\\n1\\nm on each of the m points x(1), . . . , x (\\n\\n)m forming\\nwhich puts probability mass\\na given data set or collection of samples. The Dirac delta distribution is only\\nnecessary to deï¬ne the empirical distribution over continuous variables. For discrete\\nvariables, the situation is simpler: an empirical distribution can be conceptualized\\nas a multinoulli distribution, with a probability associated to each possible input\\nvalue that is simply equal to the empirical frequency of that value in the training\\nset.\\n\\nWe can view the empirical distribution formed from a dataset of training\\nexamples as specifying the distribution that we sample from when we train a model\\non this dataset. Another important perspective on the empirical distribution is\\nthat it is the probability density that maximizes the likelihood of the training\\ndata (see Sec. 5.5). Many machine learning algorithms can be conï¬gured to have\\narbitrarily high capacity. If given enough capacity, these algorithms will simply\\nlearn the empirical distribution. This is a bad outcome because the model does not\\ngeneralize at all and assigns inï¬nitesimal probability to any point in space that did\\nnot occur in the training set. A central problem in machine learning is studying\\nhow to limit the capacity of a model in a way that prevents it from simply learning\\nthe empirical distribution while also allowing it to learn complicated functions.\\n\\n3.9.6 Mixtures of Distributions\\n\\nIt is also common to deï¬ne probability distributions by combining other simpler\\nprobability distributions. One common way of combining distributions is to\\nconstruct a mixture distribution. A mixture distribution is made up of several\\ncomponent distributions. On each trial, the choice of which component distribution\\ngenerates the sample is determined by sampling a component identity from a\\nmultinoulli distribution:\\n\\nP ( ) =x \\ue058i\\n\\nP\\n\\nc\\n( = \\n\\ni P\\n)\\n\\nx c|\\n(\\n\\n=\\n\\ni\\n)\\n\\n(3.29)\\n\\nwhere\\n\\nP ( )\\n\\nc is the multinoulli distribution over component identities.\\n\\n65\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nWe have already seen one example of a mixture distribution: the empirical\\ndistribution over real-valued variables is a mixture distribution with one Dirac\\ncomponent for each training example.\\n\\nThe mixture model is one simple strategy for combining probability distributions\\nto create a richer distribution. In Chapter 16, we explore the art of building complex\\nprobability distributions from simple ones in more detail.\\n\\nlatent variable\\n\\nThe mixture model allows us to brieï¬y glimpse a concept that will be of\\nparamount importance laterâthe\\n. A latent variable is a random\\nvariable that we cannot observe directly. The component identity variable c of the\\nmixture model provides an example. Latent variables may be related to x through\\nthe joint distribution, in this case, P (x c, ) = P (x c|\\n)P(c). The distribution P (c)\\nover the latent variable and the distribution P (x c| ) relating the latent variables\\nto the visible variables determines the shape of the distribution P ( x) even though\\nit is possible to describe P (x) without reference to the latent variable. Latent\\nvariables are discussed further in Sec. 16.5.\\n\\nA very powerful and common type of mixture model is the Gaussian mixture\\nmodel, in which the components p (x | c = i) are Gaussians. Each component has\\na separately parametrized mean Âµ ( )i and covariance Î£ ( )i . Some mixtures can have\\nmore constraints. For example, the covariances could be shared across components\\nvia the constraint Î£( )i = Î£âi. As with a single Gaussian distribution, the mixture\\nof Gaussians might constrain the covariance matrix for each component to be\\ndiagonal or isotropic.\\n\\nIn addition to the means and covariances, the parameters of a Gaussian mixture\\nspecify the prior probability Î± i = P (c = i) given to each component i. The word\\nâpriorâ indicates that it expresses the modelâs beliefs about c before it has observed\\nx. By comparison, P(c | x) is a posterior probability, because it is computed after\\nobservation of x. A Gaussian mixture model is a universal approximator of\\ndensities, in the sense that any smooth density can be approximated with any\\nspeciï¬c, non-zero amount of error by a Gaussian mixture model with enough\\ncomponents.\\n\\nFig. 3.2 shows samples from a Gaussian mixture model.\\n\\n3.10 Useful Properties of Common Functions\\n\\nCertain functions arise often while working with probability distributions, especially\\nthe probability distributions used in deep learning models.\\n\\n66\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3.

From left to right, the ï¬rst component has an isotropic covariance matrix,\\nmeaning it has the same amount of variance in each direction. The second has a diagonal\\ncovariane matrix, meaning it can control the variance separately along each axis-aligned\\ndirection. This example has more variance along the x2 axis than along the x1 axis. The\\nthird component has a full-rank covariance matrix, allowing it to control the variance\\nseparately along an abitrary basis of directions.\\n\\nOne of these functions is the logistic sigmoid:\\n\\nÏ x( ) =\\n\\n1\\n\\n1 + exp(\\n\\n.\\n)âx\\n\\n(3.30)\\n\\nThe logistic sigmoid is commonly used to produce the Ï parameter of a Bernoulli\\ndistribution because its range is (0, 1), which lies within the valid range of values\\nfor the Ï parameter. See Fig. 3.3 for a graph of the sigmoid function. The sigmoid\\nfunction saturates when its argument is very positive or very negative, meaning\\nthat the function becomes very ï¬at and insensitive to small changes in its input.\\n\\nAnother commonly encountered function is the\\n\\nsoftplus\\n\\nfunction (Dugas\\n\\net al.,\\n\\n2001):\\n\\nÎ¶ x\\nx .\\n( ) = log (1 + exp( ))\\n\\n(3.31)\\n\\nThe softplus function can be useful for producing the Î² or Ï parameter of a normal\\ndistribution because its range is (0,â).

PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\n3.12 Technical Details of Continuous Variables\\n\\nA proper formal understanding of continuous random variables and probability\\ndensity functions requires developing probability theory in terms of a branch of\\nmathematics known as measure theory. Measure theory is beyond the scope of\\nthis textbook, but we can brieï¬y sketch some of the issues that measure theory is\\nemployed to resolve.\\n\\nIn Sec. 3.3.2, we saw that the probability of a continuous vector-valued x lying\\nin some set S is given by the integral of p(x ) over the set S. Some choices of set S\\ncan produce paradoxes. For example, it is possible to construct two sets S1 and\\nS2 such that p(x â S1) + p(x â S 2) > 1 but S1 â© S2 = â. These sets are generally\\nconstructed making very heavy use of the inï¬nite precision of real numbers, for\\nexample by making fractal-shaped sets or sets that are deï¬ned by transforming\\nthe set of rational numbers2 . One of the key contributions of measure theory is to\\nprovide a characterization of the set of sets that we can compute the probability\\nof without encountering paradoxes. In this book, we only integrate over sets with\\nrelatively simple descriptions, so this aspect of measure theory never becomes a\\nrelevant concern.\\n\\nFor our purposes, measure theory is more useful for describing theorems that\\napply to most points in Rn but do not apply to some corner cases. Measure theory\\nprovides a rigorous way of describing that a set of points is negligibly small. Such\\na set is said to have âmeasure zero.â We do not formally deï¬ne this concept in this\\ntextbook. However, it is useful to understand the intuition that a set of measure\\nzero occupies no volume in the space we are measuring. For example, within R2 , a\\nline has measure zero, while a ï¬lled polygon has positive measure. Likewise, an\\nindividual point has measure zero. Any union of countably many sets that each\\nhave measure zero also has measure zero (so the set of all the rational numbers\\nhas measure zero, for instance).\\n\\nAnother useful term from measure theory is âalmost everywhere.â A property\\nthat holds almost everywhere holds throughout all of space except for on a set of\\nmeasure zero. Because the exceptions occupy a negligible amount of space, they\\ncan be safely ignored for many applications. Some important results in probability\\ntheory hold for all discrete values but only hold âalmost everywhereâ for continuous\\nvalues.\\n\\nAnother technical detail of continuous variables relates to handling continuous\\nrandom variables that are deterministic functions of one another. Suppose we have\\ntwo random variables, x and y, such that y = g(x), where g is an invertible, con-\\n\\n2The Banach-Tarski theorem provides a fun example of such sets.\\n\\n70\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\ntinuous, diï¬erentiable transformation. One might expect that py(y ) =p x(gâ1(y )).\\nThis is actually not the case.\\n\\nAs a simple example, suppose we have scalar random variables x and y. Suppose\\nIf we use the rule p y(y) = p x(2 y) then py will be 0\\non this interval. This means\\n\\ny = x\\neverywhere except the interval [0 , 1\\n2 ]\\n\\n2 and x â¼ U(0,1).\\n\\n, and it will be\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\ue05a py ( ) =\\n\\ny dy\\n\\n1\\n2\\n\\n,\\n\\n(3.43)\\n\\nwhich violates the deï¬nition of a probability distribution.\\n\\nThis common mistake is wrong because it fails to account for the distortion\\nof space introduced by the function g. Recall that the probability of x lying in\\nan inï¬nitesimally small region with volume Î´x is given by p( x)Î´x. Since g can\\nexpand or contract space, the inï¬nitesimal volume surrounding x in x space may\\nhave diï¬erent volume in\\n\\nspace.\\n\\ny\\n\\nTo see how to correct the problem, we return to the scalar case. We need to\\n\\npreserve the property\\n\\nSolving from this, we obtain\\n\\n|py( ( ))\\n\\ng x dy|\\n\\n=\\n\\n|p x( )x dx .|\\n\\nor equivalently\\n\\nIn higher dimensions, the derivative generalizes to the determinant of the Jacobian\\nmatrixâthe matrix with J i,j = âxi\\nâyj\\n\\n.

It was originally invented\\nto study sending messages from discrete alphabets over a noisy channel, such as\\ncommunication via radio transmission. In this context, information theory tells how\\nto design optimal codes and calculate the expected length of messages sampled from\\n\\n71\\n\\n(3.44)\\n\\n(3.45)\\n\\n(3.46)\\n\\n(3.47)\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nspeciï¬c probability distributions using various encoding schemes. In the context of\\nmachine learning, we can also apply information theory to continuous variables\\nwhere some of these message length interpretations do not apply. This ï¬eld is\\nfundamental to many areas of electrical engineering and computer science. In this\\ntextbook, we mostly use a few key ideas from information theory to characterize\\nprobability distributions or quantify similarity between probability distributions.\\nFor more detail on information theory, see Cover and Thomas (2006) or MacKay\\n(2003).\\n\\nThe basic intuition behind information theory is that learning that an unlikely\\nevent has occurred is more informative than learning that a likely event has\\noccurred. A message saying âthe sun rose this morningâ is so uninformative as\\nto be unnecessary to send, but a message saying âthere was a solar eclipse this\\nmorningâ is very informative.\\n\\nWe would like to quantify information in a way that formalizes this intuition.\\n\\nSpeciï¬cally,\\n\\nâ¢ Likely events should have low information content, and in the extreme case,\\nevents that are guaranteed to happen should have no information content\\nwhatsoever.\\n\\nâ¢ Less likely events should have higher information content.\\nâ¢ Independent events should have additive information. For example, ï¬nding\\nout that a tossed coin has come up as heads twice should convey twice as\\nmuch information as ï¬nding out that a tossed coin has come up as heads\\nonce.\\n\\nIn order to satisfy all three of these properties, we deï¬ne the self-information\\n\\nof an event x\\n\\n= x\\n\\nto be\\n\\nI x\\n( ) = \\n\\nlogâ\\n\\nP x .\\n( )\\n\\n(3.48)\\n\\nIn this book, we always use log to mean the natural logarithm, with base e. Our\\ndeï¬nition of I(x) is therefore written in units of\\n. One nat is the amount of\\ninformation gained by observing an event of probability 1\\ne . Other texts use base-2\\nlogarithms and units called\\nshannons\\n; information measured in bits is just\\na rescaling of information measured in nats.\\n\\nnats\\n\\nbits\\n\\nor\\n\\nWhen x is continuous, we use the same deï¬nition of information by analogy,\\nbut some of the properties from the discrete case are lost. For example, an event\\nwith unit density still has zero information, despite not being an event that is\\nguaranteed to occur.\\n\\n72\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3.

The entropy is given by\\nlog . When p is near 0, the distribution\\nis nearly deterministic, because the random variable is nearly always 0. When p is near 1,\\nthe distribution is nearly deterministic, because the random variable is nearly always 1.\\nWhen p = 0 .5, the entropy is maximal, because the distribution is uniform over the two\\noutcomes.\\n\\n(pâ 1) log(1â p )â p\\n\\np\\n\\nSelf-information deals only with a single outcome.

In other words, the Shannon entropy of a distribution is the\\nexpected amount of information in an event drawn from that distribution. It gives\\na lower bound on the number of bits (if the logarithm is base 2, otherwise the units\\nare diï¬erent) needed on average to encode symbols drawn from a distribution P.\\nDistributions that are nearly deterministic (where the outcome is nearly certain)\\nhave low entropy; distributions that are closer to uniform have high entropy. See\\nFig. 3.5 for a demonstration. When x is continous, the Shannon entropy is known\\nas the diï¬erential entropy.\\n\\nIf we have two separate probability distributions P(x) and Q(x) over the same\\nrandom variable x, we can measure how diï¬erent these two distributions are using\\nthe Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence:\\n\\nDKL(\\n\\nP Q\\ue06b\\n\\n) = \\n\\nE xâ¼P\\ue014log\\n\\nP x( )\\n\\nQ x( )\\ue015 = Exâ¼P [log ( )\\n\\nP x â\\n\\n73\\n\\nlog ( )]\\nQ x .\\n\\n(3.50)\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nIn the case of discrete variables, it is the extra amount of information (measured\\nin bits if we use the base\\nlogarithm, but in machine learning we usually use nats\\nand the natural logarithm) needed to send a message containing symbols drawn\\nfrom probability distribution P , when we use a code that was designed to minimize\\nthe length of messages drawn from probability distribution\\n\\n.Q\\n\\n2\\n\\nThe KL divergence has many useful properties, most notably that it is non-\\nnegative. The KL divergence is 0 if and only if P and Qare the same distribution in\\nthe case of discrete variables, or equal âalmost everywhereâ in the case of continuous\\nvariables. Because the KL divergence is non-negative and measures the diï¬erence\\nbetween two distributions, it is often conceptualized as measuring some sort of\\ndistance between these distributions. However, it is not a true distance measure\\nbecause it is not symmetric: DKL(P Q\\ue06b ) \\ue036= DKL( Q P\\ue06b ) for some P and Q. This\\nasymmetry means that there are important consequences to the choice of whether\\nto use DKL(\\n\\n. See Fig. 3.6 for more detail.\\n\\nor DKL (\\n\\n)\\n\\nP Q\\ue06b\\n\\n)Q P\\ue06b\\n\\nA quantity that is closely related to the KL divergence is the cross-entropy\\nH (P, Q ) = H (P) + DKL(P Q\\ue06b ), which is similar to the KL divergence but lacking\\nthe term on the left:\\n(3.51)\\n\\nH P, Q(\\n\\n) = âE\\n\\nxâ¼P log ( )Q x .\\n\\nMinimizing the cross-entropy with respect to Q is equivalent to minimizing the\\nKL divergence, because\\n\\ndoes not participate in the omitted term.\\n\\nQ\\n\\nWhen computing many of these quantities, it is common to encounter expres-\\nsions of the form 0log 0.

Often, these probability distributions involve\\ndirect interactions between relatively few variables. Using a single function to\\ndescribe the entire joint probability distribution can be very ineï¬cient (both\\ncomputationally and statistically).\\n\\nInstead of using a single function to represent a probability distribution, we\\ncan split a probability distribution into many factors that we multiply together.\\nFor example, suppose we have three random variables: a, b and c . Suppose that\\na inï¬uences the value of b and b inï¬uences the value of c, but that a and c are\\nindependent given b. We can represent the probability distribution over all three\\n\\n74\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3.

Suppose we have a distribution p(x ) and\\nwish to approximate it with another distribution q(x). We have the choice of minimizing\\neither DKL( p q\\ue06b ) or DKL( q p\\ue06b ). We illustrate the eï¬ect of this choice using a mixture of\\ntwo Gaussians for p, and a single Gaussian for q. The choice of which direction of the\\nKL divergence to use is problem-dependent. Some applications require an approximation\\nthat usually places high probability anywhere that the true distribution places high\\nprobability, while other applications require an approximation that rarely places high\\nprobability anywhere that the true distribution places low probability. The choice of the\\ndirection of the KL divergence reï¬ects which of these considerations takes priority for each\\napplication. (Left) The eï¬ect of minimizing DKL (p q\\ue06b ). In this case, we select a q that has\\nhigh probability where p has high probability. When p has multiple modes, q chooses to\\nblur the modes together, in order to put high probability mass on all of them. (Right) The\\neï¬ect of minimizing DKL (q p\\ue06b ). In this case, we select a q that has low probability where\\np has low probability. When p has multiple modes that are suï¬ciently widely separated,\\nas in this ï¬gure, the KL divergence is minimized by choosing a single mode, in order to\\navoid putting probability mass in the low-probability areas between modes of p . Here, we\\nillustrate the outcome when q is chosen to emphasize the left mode. We could also have\\nachieved an equal value of the KL divergence by choosing the right mode. If the modes\\nare not separated by a suï¬ciently strong low probability region, then this direction of the\\nKL divergence can still choose to blur the modes.\\n\\n75\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3.

Each factor uses a number of parameters that is\\nexponential in the number of variables in the factor. This means that we can greatly\\nreduce the cost of representing a distribution if we are able to ï¬nd a factorization\\ninto distributions over fewer variables.\\n\\nWe can describe these kinds of factorizations using graphs. Here we use the\\nword âgraphâ in the sense of graph theory: a set of vertices that may be connected\\nto each other with edges. When we represent the factorization of a probability\\ndistribution with a graph, we call it a structured probabilistic model\\ngraphical\\nmodel.\\n\\nor\\n\\nThere are two main kinds of structured probabilistic models: directed and\\nundirected. Both kinds of graphical models use a graph G in which each node\\nin the graph corresponds to a random variable, and an edge connecting two\\nrandom variables means that the probability distribution is able to represent direct\\ninteractions between those two random variables.\\n\\nDirected models use graphs with directed edges, and they represent factoriza-\\ntions into conditional probability distributions, as in the example above. Speciï¬cally,\\na directed model contains one factor for every random variable x i in the distribution,\\nand that factor consists of the conditional distribution over xi given the parents of\\nxi, denoted P a G(x i):\\n\\n(3.53)\\n\\np( ) =x \\ue059i\\n\\np (xi | P aG (xi )) .\\n\\nSee Fig. 3.7 for an example of a directed graph and the factorization of probability\\ndistributions it represents.\\n\\nUndirected models use graphs with undirected edges, and they represent fac-\\ntorizations into a set of functions; unlike in the directed case, these functions are\\nusually not probability distributions of any kind. Any set of nodes that are all\\nconnected to each other in G is called a clique. Each clique C ( )i\\nin an undirected\\nmodel is associated with a factor Ï( )i (C ( )i ). These factors are just functions, not\\nprobability distributions. The output of each factor must be non-negative, but\\nthere is no constraint that the factor must sum or integrate to 1 like a probability\\ndistribution.\\n\\nThe probability of a conï¬guration of random variables is proportional to the\\nproduct of all of these factorsâassignments that result in larger factor values are\\n\\n76\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3.

       "'Machine learning algorithms often involve probability distributions over a very\\nlarge number of random variables. Often, these probability distributions involve\\ndirect interactions between relatively few variables. Using a single function to\\ndescribe the entire joint probability distribution can be very ineï¬cient (both\\ncomputationally and statistically).\\n\\nInstead of using a single function to represent a probability distribution, we\\ncan split a probability distribution into many factors that we multiply together.\\nFor example, suppose we have three random variables: a, b and c . Suppose that\\na inï¬uences the value of b and b inï¬uences the value of c, but that a and c are\\nindependent given b. We can represent the probability distribution over all three\\n\\n74\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3.

Suppose we have a distribution p(x ) and\\nwish to approximate it with another distribution q(x). We have the choice of minimizing\\neither DKL( p q\\ue06b ) or DKL( q p\\ue06b ). We illustrate the eï¬ect of this choice using a mixture of\\ntwo Gaussians for p, and a single Gaussian for q. The choice of which direction of the\\nKL divergence to use is problem-dependent. Some applications require an approximation\\nthat usually places high probability anywhere that the true distribution places high\\nprobability, while other applications require an approximation that rarely places high\\nprobability anywhere that the true distribution places low probability. The choice of the\\ndirection of the KL divergence reï¬ects which of these considerations takes priority for each\\napplication. (Left) The eï¬ect of minimizing DKL (p q\\ue06b ). In this case, we select a q that has\\nhigh probability where p has high probability. When p has multiple modes, q chooses to\\nblur the modes together, in order to put high probability mass on all of them. (Right) The\\neï¬ect of minimizing DKL (q p\\ue06b ). In this case, we select a q that has low probability where\\np has low probability. When p has multiple modes that are suï¬ciently widely separated,\\nas in this ï¬gure, the KL divergence is minimized by choosing a single mode, in order to\\navoid putting probability mass in the low-probability areas between modes of p . Here, we\\nillustrate the outcome when q is chosen to emphasize the left mode. We could also have\\nachieved an equal value of the KL divergence by choosing the right mode. If the modes\\nare not separated by a suï¬ciently strong low probability region, then this direction of the\\nKL divergence can still choose to blur the modes.\\n\\n75\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3.

Each factor uses a number of parameters that is\\nexponential in the number of variables in the factor. This means that we can greatly\\nreduce the cost of representing a distribution if we are able to ï¬nd a factorization\\ninto distributions over fewer variables.\\n\\nWe can describe these kinds of factorizations using graphs. Here we use the\\nword âgraphâ in the sense of graph theory: a set of vertices that may be connected\\nto each other with edges. When we represent the factorization of a probability\\ndistribution with a graph, we call it a structured probabilistic model\\ngraphical\\nmodel.\\n\\nor\\n\\nThere are two main kinds of structured probabilistic models: directed and\\nundirected. Both kinds of graphical models use a graph G in which each node\\nin the graph corresponds to a random variable, and an edge connecting two\\nrandom variables means that the probability distribution is able to represent direct\\ninteractions between those two random variables.\\n\\nDirected models use graphs with directed edges, and they represent factoriza-\\ntions into conditional probability distributions, as in the example above. Speciï¬cally,\\na directed model contains one factor for every random variable x i in the distribution,\\nand that factor consists of the conditional distribution over xi given the parents of\\nxi, denoted P a G(x i):\\n\\n(3.53)\\n\\np( ) =x \\ue059i\\n\\np (xi | P aG (xi )) .\\n\\nSee Fig. 3.7 for an example of a directed graph and the factorization of probability\\ndistributions it represents.\\n\\nUndirected models use graphs with undirected edges, and they represent fac-\\ntorizations into a set of functions; unlike in the directed case, these functions are\\nusually not probability distributions of any kind. Any set of nodes that are all\\nconnected to each other in G is called a clique. Each clique C ( )i\\nin an undirected\\nmodel is associated with a factor Ï( )i (C ( )i ). These factors are just functions, not\\nprobability distributions. The output of each factor must be non-negative, but\\nthere is no constraint that the factor must sum or integrate to 1 like a probability\\ndistribution.\\n\\nThe probability of a conï¬guration of random variables is proportional to the\\nproduct of all of these factorsâassignments that result in larger factor values are\\n\\n76\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3.

qualiï¬cation for efï¬cient citizenship as the ability to\\nread and write. â Samuel Wilkes, 1951, paraphrasing H. G. Wells from Mankind in the Making\\n\\nThe value of statistical thinking is now accepted by researchers and practitioners from a broad range of endeavors.\\nThis viewpoint has become common wisdom in a world of big data. The challenge for statistics educators is to adapt\\ntheir pedagogy to accommodate the circumstances associated to the information age. This choice of pedagogy should\\nbe attuned to the quantitative capabilities and scientiï¬c background of the students as well as the intended use of their\\nnewly acquired knowledge of statistics.\\n\\nMany university students, presumed to be proï¬cient in college algebra, are taught a variety of procedures and\\nstandard tests under a well-developed pedagogy. This approach is sufï¬ciently reï¬ned so that students have a good\\nintuitive understanding of the underlying principles presented in the course. However, if the statistical needs presented\\nby a given scientiï¬c question fall outside the battery of methods presented in the standard curriculum, then students\\nare typically at a loss to adjust the procedures to accommodate the additional demand.\\n\\nOn the other hand, undergraduate students majoring in mathematics frequently have a course on the theory of\\nstatistics as a part of their program of study. In this case, the standard curriculum repeatedly ï¬nds itself close to the\\nvery practically minded subject that statistics is. However, the demands of the syllabus provide very little time to\\nexplore these applications with any sustained attention.\\n\\nOur goal is to ï¬nd a middle ground.\\nDespite the fact that calculus is a routine tool in the development of statistics, the beneï¬ts to students who have\\nlearned calculus are infrequently employed in the statistics curriculum. The objective of this book is to meet this need\\nwith a one semester course in statistics that moves forward in recognition of the coherent body of knowledge provided\\nby statistical theory having an eye consistently on the application of the subject. Such a course may not be able to\\nachieve the same degree of completeness now presented by the two more standard courses described above. However,\\nit ought to able to achieve some important goals:\\n\\nâ¢ leaving students capable of understanding what statistical thinking is and how to integrate this with scientiï¬c\\n\\nprocedures and quantitative modeling and\\n\\nâ¢ learning how to ask statistics experts productive questions, and how to implement their ideas using statistical\\n\\nsoftware and other computational tools.\\n\\nInevitably, many important topics are not included in this book. In addition, I have chosen to incorporate abbre-\\nviated introductions of some more advanced topics. Such topics can be skipped in a ï¬rst pass through the material.\\nHowever, one value of a textbook is that it can serve as a reference in future years. The context for some parts of\\nthe exposition will become more clear as students continue their own education in statistics. In these cases, the more\\nadvanced pieces can serve as a bridge from this book to more well developed accounts. My goal is not to compose a\\nstand alone treatise, but rather to build a foundation that allows those who have worked through this book to introduce\\nthemselves to many exciting topics both in statistics and in its areas of application.\\n\\nvii\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nWho Should Use this Book\\nThe major prerequisites are comfort with calculus and a strong interest in questions that can beneï¬t from statistical\\nanalysis. Willingness to engage in explorations utilizing statistical software is an important additional requirement.\\nThe original audience for the course associated to this book are undergraduate students minoring in mathematics.\\nThese student have typically completed a course in multivariate calculus. Many have been exposed to either linear\\nalgebra or differential equations. They enroll in this course because they want to obtain a better understanding of\\ntheir own core subject. Even though we regularly rely on the mechanics of calculus and occasionally need to work\\nwith matrices, this is not a textbook for a mathematics course, but rather a textbook that is dedicated to a higher level\\nof understanding of the concepts and practical applications of statistics. In this regard, it relies on a solid grasp of\\nconcepts and structures in calculus and algebra.\\n\\nWith the advance and adoption of the Common Core State Standards in mathematics, we can anticipate that\\nprimary and secondary school students will experience a broader exposure to statistics through their school years. As\\na consequence, we will need to develop a curriculum for teachers and future teachers so that they can take content in\\nstatistics and turn that into curriculum for their students. This book can serve as a source of that content.\\n\\nIn addition, those engaged both in industry and in scholarly research are experiencing a surge in the need to\\ndesign more complex experiments and analyze more diverse data types. Universities and industry are responding with\\nadvanced educational opportunities to extend statistics education beyond the theory of probability and statistics, linear\\nmodels and design of experiments to more modern approaches that include stochastic processes, machine learning and\\ndata mining, Bayesian statistics, and statistical computing. This book can serve as an entry point for these critical\\ntopics in statistics.\\n\\nAn Annotated Syllabus\\nThe four parts of the course - organizing and collecting data, an introduction to probability, estimation procedures and\\nhypothesis testing - are the building blocks of many statistics courses. We highlight some of the particular features in\\nthis book.\\n\\nOrganizing and Collecting Data\\nMuch of this is standard and essential - organizing categorical and quantitative data, appropriately displayed as contin-\\ngency tables, bar charts, histograms, boxplots, time plots, and scatterplots, and summarized using medians, quartiles,\\nmeans, weighted means, trimmed means, standard deviations, correlations and regression lines. We use this as an\\nopportunity to introduce to the statistical software package R and to add additional summaries like the empirical cu-\\nmulative distribution function and the empirical survival function. One example incorporating the use of this is the\\ncomparison of the lifetimes of wildtype and transgenic mosquitoes and a discussion of the best strategy to display and\\nsummarize data if the goal is to examine the differences in these two genotypes of mosquitoes in their ability to carry\\nand spread malaria. A bit later, we will do an integration by parts exercise to show that the mean of a non-negative\\ncontinuous random variable is the area under its survival function.\\n\\nCollecting data under a good design is introduced early in the text and discussion of the underlying principles of\\nexperimental design is an abiding issue throughout the text. With each new mathematical or statistical concept comes\\nan enhanced understanding of what an experiment might uncover through a more sophisticated design than what was\\npreviously thought possible. The students are given readings on design of experiment and examples using R to create\\na sample under variety of protocols.\\n\\nIntroduction to Probability\\nProbability theory is the analysis of random phenomena. It is built on the axioms of probability and is explored, for\\nexample, through the introduction of random variables. The goal of probability theory is to uncover properties arising\\nfrom the phenomena under study. Statistics is devoted to the analysis of data. One goal of statistical science is to\\n\\nviii\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\narticulate as well as possible what model of random phenomena underlies the production of the data. The focus of this\\nsection of the course is to develop those probabilistic ideas that relate most directly to the needs of statistics.\\n\\nThus, we must study the axioms and basic properties of probability to the extent that the students understand\\nconditional probability and independence. Conditional probability is necessary to develop Bayes formula which we\\nwill later use to give a taste of the Bayesian approach to statistics.\\nIndependence will be needed to describe the\\nlikelihood function in the case of an experimental design that is based on independent observations. Densities for\\ncontinuous random variables and mass function for discrete random variables are necessary to write these likelihood\\nfunctions explicitly. Expectation will be used to standardize a sample sum or sample mean and to perform method of\\nmoments estimates.\\n\\nRandom variables are developed for a variety of reasons. Some, like the binomial, negative binomial, Poisson or\\nthe gamma random variable, arise from considerations based on Bernoulli trials or exponential waiting. The hyperge-\\nometric random variable helps us understand the difference between sampling with and without replacement. The F ,\\nt and chi-square random variables will later become test statistics. Uniform random variables are the ones simulated\\nby random number generators. Because of the central limit theorem, the normal family is the most important among\\nthe list of parametric families of random variables.\\n\\nThe ï¬avor of the text returns to becoming more authentically statistical with the law of large numbers and the\\ncentral limit theorem. These are largely developed using simulation explorations and ï¬rst applied to simple Monte\\nCarlo techniques and importance sampling to estimate the value of an deï¬nite integrals. One cautionary tale is an\\nexample of the failure of these simulation techniques when applied without careful analysis. If one uses, for example,\\nCauchy random variables in the evaluation of some quantity, then the simulated sample means can appear to be\\nconverging only to experience an abrupt and unpredictable jump. The lack of convergence of an improper integral\\nreveals the difï¬culty. The central object of study is, of course, the central limit theorem. It is developed both in terms\\nof sample sums and sample means and proportions and used in relatively standard ways to estimate probabilities.\\nHowever, in this book, we can introduce the delta method which adds ideas associated to the central limit theorem to\\nthe context of propagation of error.\\n\\nEstimation\\nIn the simplest possible terms, the goal of estimation theory is to answer the question: What is that number? An\\nestimate is a statistic, i. e., a function of the data. We look to two types of estimation techniques - method of moments\\nand maximum likelihood and several criteria for an estimator using, for example, variance and bias. Several examples\\nincluding mark and recapture and the distribution of ï¬tness effects from genetic data are developed for both types of\\nestimators. The variance of an estimator is approximated using the delta method for method of moments estimators\\nand using Fisher information for maximum likelihood estimators. An analysis of bias is based on quadratic Taylor\\nseries approximations and the properties of expectations. Both classes of estimators are often consistent. This implies\\nthat the bias decreases towards zero with an increasing number of observations. R is routinely used in simulations to\\ngain insight into the quality of estimators.\\n\\nThe point estimation techniques are followed by interval estimation and, notably, by conï¬dence intervals. This\\nbrings us to the familiar one and two sample t-intervals for population means and one and two sample z-intervals for\\npopulation proportions. In addition, we can return to the delta method and the observed Fisher information to construct\\nconï¬dence intervals associated respectively to method of moment estimators and and maximum likelihood estimators.\\nWe also add a brief introduction on bootstrap conï¬dence intervals and Bayesian credible intervals in order to provide\\na broader introduction to strategies for parameter estimation.\\n\\nHypothesis Testing\\nFor hypothesis testing, we ï¬rst establish the central issues - null and alternative hypotheses, type I and type II errors,\\ntest statistics and critical regions, signiï¬cance and power. We then present the ideas behind the use of likelihood ratio\\ntests as best tests for a simple hypothesis. This is motivated by a game designed to explain the importance of the\\nNeyman Pearson lemma. This approach leads us to well-known diagnostics of an experimental design, notably, the\\nreceiver operating characteristic and power curves.\\n\\nix\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nExtensions of the Neyman Pearson lemma form the basis for the t test for means, the chi-square test for goodness\\nof ï¬t, and the F test for analysis of variance. These results follow from the application of optimization techniques\\nfrom calculus, including the use of Lagrange multipliers to develop goodness of ï¬t tests. The Bayesian approach\\nto hypothesis testing is explored for the case of simple hypothesis using morphometric measurements, in this case a\\nbutterï¬y wingspan, to test whether a habitat has been invaded by a mimic species.\\n\\nThe desire of a powerful test is articulated in a variety of ways. In engineering terms, power is called sensitivity.\\nWe illustrate this with a radon detector. An insensitive instrument is a risky purchase. This can be either because\\nthe instrument is substandard in the detection of ï¬uctuations or poor in the statistical basis for the algorithm used to\\ndetermine a change in radon level. An insensitive detector has the undesirable property of not sounding its alarm when\\nthe radon level has indeed risen.\\n\\nThe course ends by looking at the logic of hypotheses testing and the results of different likelihood ratio analyses\\napplied to a variety of experimental designs. The delta method allows us to extend the resulting test statistics to\\nmultivariate nonlinear transformations of the data. The textbook concludes with a practical view of the consequences\\nof this analysis through case studies in a variety of disciplines including, for example, genetics, health, ecology,\\nand bee biology. This will serve to introduce us to the well known t procedure for inference of the mean, both the\\nlikelihood-based G2 test and the traditional chi-square test for discrete distributions and contingency tables, and the\\nF test for one-way analysis of variance. We add short descriptions for the corresponding non-parametric procedures,\\nnamely, permutation, ranked-sum and signed-rank tests for quantitative data, and exact tests for categorical data\\n\\nExercises and Problems\\nOne obligatory statement in the preface of a book such as this is to note the necessity of working problems. The mate-\\nrial can only be mastered by grappling with the issues through the application to engaging and substantive questions.\\nIn this book, we address this imperative through exercises and through problems. The exercises, integrated into the\\ntextbook narrative, are of two basic types. The ï¬rst is largely mathematical or computational exercises that are meant\\nto provide or extend the derivation of a useful identity or data analysis technique. These experiences will prepare the\\nstudent to perform the calculations that routinely occur in investigations that use statistical thinking. The second type\\nform a collection of questions that are meant to afï¬rm the understanding of a particular concept.\\n\\nProblems are collected at the end of each of the four parts of the book. While the ordering of the problems generally\\nfollows the ï¬ow of the text, they are designed to be more extensive and integrative. These problems often incorporate\\nseveral concepts and will call on a variety of problem solving strategies combining handwritten work with the use of\\nstatistical software. Without question, the best problems are those that the students chose from their own interests.\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\nThe concept that let to this book grew out of a conversation with the late Michael Wells, Professor of Biochemistry\\nat the University of Arizona. He felt that if we are asking future life scientist researchers to take the time to learn\\ncalculus and differential equations, we should also provide a statistics course that adds value to their abilities to design\\nexperiments and analyze data while reinforcing both the practical and conceptual sides of calculus. As a consequence,\\ncourse development received initial funding from a Howard Hughes Medical Institute grant (52005889). Christopher\\nBergevin, an HHMI postdoctoral fellow, provided a valuable initial collaboration.\\n\\nSince that time, I have had the great fortune to be the teacher of many bright and dedicated students whose future\\ncontribution to our general well-being is beyond dispute. Their cheerfulness and inquisitiveness has been a source\\nof inspiration for me. More practically, their questions and their persistence led to a much clearer exposition and\\nthe addition of many dozens of ï¬gures to the text. Through their end of semester projects, I have been introduced\\nto many interesting questions that are intriguing in their own right, but also have added to the range of applications\\npresented throughout the text. Four of these students - Beryl Jones, Clayton Mosher, Laurel Watkins de Jong, and\\nTaylor Corcoran - have gone on to become assistants in the course. I am particularly thankful to these four for their\\ncontributions to the dynamical atmosphere that characterizes the class experience.\\n\\nx\\n\\n\\x0cPart I\\n\\nOrganizing and Producing Data\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0cTopic 1\\n\\nDisplaying Data\\n\\nThere are two goals when presenting data: convey your story and establish credibility. - Edward Tufte\\n\\nStatistics is a mathematical science that is concerned with the collection, analysis, interpretation or explanation,\\nand presentation of data. Properly used statistical principles are essential in guiding any inquiry informed by data and,\\nespecially in the phase of data exploration, is routinely a fundamental source for discovery and innovation. Insights\\nfrom data may come from a well conceived visualization of the data, from modern methods of statistical learning and\\nmodel selection as well as from time-honored formal statistical procedures.\\n\\nThe ï¬rst encounters one has to data are through graphical displays and numerical summaries. The goal is to ï¬nd\\nan elegant method for this presentation that is at the same time both objective and informative - making clear with a\\nfew lines or a few numbers the salient features of the data. In this sense, data presentation is at the same time an art, a\\nscience, and an obligation to impartiality.\\n\\nIn the section, we will describe some of the standard presentations of data and at the same time, taking the opportu-\\nnity to introduce some of the commands that the software package R provides to draw ï¬gures and compute summaries\\nof the data.\\n\\n1.1 Types of Data\\nA data set provides information about a group of individuals. These individuals are, typically, representatives chosen\\nfrom a population under study. Data on the individuals are meant, either informally or formally, to allow us to make\\ninferences about the population. We shall later discuss how to deï¬ne a population, how to choose individuals in the\\npopulation and how to collect data on these individuals.\\nâ¢ Individuals are the objects described by the data.\\nâ¢ Variables are characteristics of an individual. In order to present data, we must ï¬rst recognize the types of data\\n\\nunder consideration.\\n\\nâ Categorical variables partition the individuals into classes. Other names for categorical variables are\\nlevels or factors. One special type of categorical variables are ordered categorical variables that suggest\\na ranking, say small. medium, large or mild, moderate, severe.\\n\\nâ Quantitative variables are those for which arithmetic operations like addition and differences make sense.\\n\\nExample 1.1 (individuals and variables). We consider two populations - the ï¬rst is the nations of the world and the\\nsecond is the people who live in those countries. Below is a collection of variables that might be used to study these\\npopulations.\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nDisplaying Data\\n\\nnations\\n\\npeople\\n\\npopulation size\\n\\ntime zones\\n\\naverage rainfall\\nlife expectancy\\nmean income\\nliteracy rate\\ncapital city\\nlargest river\\n\\nage\\nheight\\ngender\\n\\nethnicities\\n\\nannual income\\n\\nliteracy\\n\\nmotherâs maiden name\\n\\nmarital status\\n\\nExercise 1.2. Classify the variables as quantitative or categorical in the example above.\\n\\nThe naming of variables and their classiï¬cation as categorical or quantitative may seem like a simple, even trite,\\nexercise. However, the ï¬rst steps in designing an experiment and deciding on which individuals to include and which\\ninformation to collect are vital to the success of the experiment. For example, if your goal is to measure the time for\\nan animal (insect, bird, mammal) to complete some task under different (genetic, environmental, learning) conditions,\\nthen, you may decide to have a single quantitative variable - the time to complete the task. However, an animal in\\nyour study may not attempt the task, may not complete the task, or may perform the task. As a consequence, your\\ndata analysis will run into difï¬culties if you do not add a categorical variable to include these possible outcomes of an\\nexperiment.\\n\\nExercise 1.3. Give examples of variables for the population of vertebrates, of proteins.\\n\\n1.2 Categorical Data\\n1.2.1 Pie Chart\\nA pie chart is a circular chart divided into sectors, illustrating relative magnitudes in frequencies or percents. In a pie\\nchart, the area is proportional to the quantity it represents.\\n\\nExample 1.4. As the nation debates strategies for delivering health insurance, letâs look at the sources of funds and\\nthe types of expenditures.\\n\\nFigure 1.1: 2008 United States health care (a) expenditures (b) income sources, Source: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Ofï¬ce of\\nthe Actuary, National Health Statistics Group\\n\\n4\\n\\n  \\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nDisplaying Data\\n\\nExercise 1.5. How do you anticipate that this pie chart will evolve over the next decade? Which pie slices are likely\\nto become larger? smaller? On what do you base your predictions?\\nExample 1.6. From UNICEF, we read âThe proportion of children who reach their ï¬fth birthday is one of the most\\nfundamental indicators of a countryâs concern for its people. Child survival statistics are a poignant indicator of the\\npriority given to the services that help a child to ï¬ourish: adequate supplies of nutritious food, the availability of high-\\nquality health care and easy access to safe water and sanitation facilities, as well as the familyâs overall economic\\ncondition and the health and status of women in the community. â\\n\\nExample 1.7.

Hemoglobin E is a variant of hemoglobin with a mutation in the Î² globin gene causing substitution of\\nglutamic acid for lysine at position 26 of the Î² globin chain. HbE (E is the one letter abbreviation for glutamic acid.)\\nis the second most common abnormal hemoglobin after sickle cell hemoglobin (HbS). HbE is common from India to\\nSoutheast Asia. The Î² chain of HbE is synthesized at a reduced rate compare to normal hemoglobin (HbA) as the HbE\\nproduces an alternate splicing site within an exon.\\n\\nIt has been suggested that Hemoglobin E provides some protection against malaria virulence when heterozygous,\\nbut is causes anemia when homozygous. The circumstance in which the heterozygotes for the alleles under considera-\\ntion have a higher adaptive value than the homozygote is called balancing selection.\\n\\nThe table below gives the counts of differing hemoglobin genotypes on two Indonesian islands.\\n\\ngenotype AA AE EE\\n0\\nFlores\\nSumba\\n4\\n\\n128\\n119\\n\\n6\\n78\\n\\nBecause the heterozygotes are rare on Flores, it appears malaria is less prevalent there since the heterozygote does\\nnot provide an adaptive advantage.\\n\\nExercise 1.11. Make a segmented barchart of the data on hemoglobin genotypes. Have each bar display the distribu-\\ntion of genotypes on the two Indonesian islands.\\n\\n1.4 Histograms and the Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function\\nHistograms are a common visual representation of a quantitative variable. Histograms summarize the data using\\nrectangles to display either frequencies or proportions as normalized frequencies. In making a histogram, we\\n\\nâ¢ Divide the range of data into bins of equal width (usually, but not always).\\nâ¢ Count the number of observations in each class.\\nâ¢ Draw the histogram rectangles representing frequencies or percents by area.\\nInterpret the histogram by giving\\nâ¢ the overall pattern\\n\\nâ the center\\nâ the spread\\nâ the shape (symmetry, skewness, peaks)\\n\\nâ¢ and deviations from the pattern\\n\\nâ outliers\\nâ gaps\\n\\nThe direction of the skewness is the direction of the longer of the two tails (left or right) of the distribution.\\nNo one choice for the number of bins is considered best. One possible choice for larger data sets is Sturgesâ\\n\\nformula to choose (cid:98)1 + log2 n(cid:99) bins. ((cid:98)Â·(cid:99), the ï¬oor function, is obtained by rounding down to the next integer.)\\nExercise 1.12. The histograms in Figure 1.4 shows the distribution of lengths of a normal strain and mutant strain of\\nBacillus subtilis. Describe the distributions.\\n\\nExample 1.13.

The values of the ï¬rst variable x1, x2, . . . , xn are assumed known and in an\\nexperiment and are often set by the experimenter. This variable is called the explanatory, predictor, discriptor, or\\ninput variables and in a two dimensional scatterplot of the data display its values on the horizontal axis. The values\\ny1, y2 . . . , yn, taken from observations with input x1, x2, . . . , xn are called the response or target variable and its\\nvalues are displayed on the vertical axis.

Genetic evolution is based on mutation. Consequently, one fundamental question in evolutionary\\nbiology is the rate of de novo mutations. To investigate this question in humans, Kong et al, sequenced the entire\\ngenomes of 78 Icelandic trios and recorded the age of the parents and the number of de novo mutations in the offspring.\\nThe plot shows a moderate positive linear association, children of older parent have, on average, more mutations.\\nThe number of mutations range from â¼ 40 for children of younger parents to â¼ 100 for children of older parents. We\\nwill later learn that the father is the major source of this difference with age.\\n\\nExample 1.17 (Fossils of the Archeopteryx).

Sindona used the bankâs ability to transfer funds, produce\\nletters of credit, and trade in foreign currencies to begin building a banking empire in the United States.

The US petroleum industry began with Edwin Drakeâs drilling\\nof a 69-foot deep oil well in 1859 on Oil Creek near Titusville, Pennsylvania for the Seneca Oil Company. The industry\\ngrew through the 1800s, driven by the demand for kerosene and oil lamps. The introduction of the internal combustion\\nengine in the early part of the 20th century provided a demand that has largely sustained the industry to this day.\\nToday, about 90% of vehicular fuel needs are met by oil. Petroleum also makes up 40% of total energy consumption\\nin the United States, but is responsible for only 2% of electricity generation.

The panel was established in 1988 by the\\nWorld Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme, two organizations of the United\\nNations. The IPCC does not perform original research but rather uses three working groups who synthesize research\\nand prepare a report. In addition, the IPCC prepares a summary report.

At the risk of discussing concepts\\nthat have not yet been introduced, letâs describe the technique behind local regression. Typically, at each point in the\\ndata set, the goal is to draw a linear or quadratic function. The function is determined using weighted least squares,\\ngiving most weight to nearby points and less weight to points further away. The graphs above show the approximating\\ncurves. The blue regions show areas within two standard deviations of the estimate (called a conï¬dence interval). The\\ngoal of local regression is to provide a smooth approximation to the data and a sense of the uncertainty of the data.

It is hard to tell the truth without it. - Andrejs Dunkels\\n\\nWe next look at quantitative data. Recall that in this case, these data can be subject to the operations of arithmetic.\\n\\nIn particular, we can add or subtract observation values, we can sort them and rank them from lowest to highest.\\n\\nWe will look at two fundamental properties of these observations. The ï¬rst is a measure of the center value for\\nthe data, i.e., the median or the mean. Associated to this measure, we add a second value that describes how these\\nobservations are spread or dispersed about this given measure of center.\\n\\nThe median is the central observation of the data after it is sorted from the lowest to highest observations. In\\naddition, to give a sense of the spread in the data, we often give the smallest and largest observations as well as the\\nobserved value that is 1/4 and 3/4 of the way up this list, known at the ï¬rst and third quartiles. This difference, known\\nas the interquartile range is a measure of the spread or the dispersion of the data. For the mean, we commonly use\\nthe standard deviation to describe the spread of the data.\\n\\nThese concepts are described in more detail in this section.\\n\\n2.1 Measuring Center\\n2.1.1 Medians\\nThe median take the middle value for x1, x2, . . . , xn after the data has been sorted from smallest to largest,\\n\\nx(1), x(2), . . . , x(n).\\n\\n(x(k) is called the k-th order statistic. Sorting can be accomplished in R by using the sort command.)\\nIf n is odd, then this is just the value of the middle observation x((n+1)/2). If n is even, then the two values closest\\n\\nto the center are averaged.\\n\\n1\\n2\\n\\n(x(n/2) + x(n/2+1)).\\n\\nIf we store the data in R in a vector x, we can write median(x) to compute the median.\\n\\n2.1.2 Means\\nFor a collection of numeric data, x1, x2, . . . , xn, the sample mean is the numerical average\\n\\nÂ¯x =\\n\\n1\\nn\\n\\n(x1 + x2 + . . . + xn) =\\n\\n1\\nn\\n\\nn(cid:88)i=1\\n\\nxi\\n\\n21\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nDescribing Distributions with Numbers\\n\\nAlternatively, if the value x occurs n(x) times in the data, then use the distributive property to see that\\n\\nÂ¯x =\\n\\n1\\n\\nn(cid:88)x\\n\\nxn(x) =(cid:88)x\\n\\nxp(x), where p(x) =\\n\\nn(x)\\n\\nn\\n\\n.\\n\\nSo the mean Â¯x depends only on the proportion of observations p(x) for each value of x.\\n\\nExample 2.1. For the data set {1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5}, we have n = 10 and the sum\\n\\n1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 5 = 1n(1) + 2n(2) + 3n(3) + 4n(4) + 5n(5)\\n\\n= 1(1) + 2(3) + 3(2) + 4(3) + 5(1) = 30\\n\\nThus, Â¯x = 30/10 = 3.\\n\\nExample 2.2.

Generalize this formula for the case of k\\nadditional observations xn+1 . . . , xn+k\\n\\nMany times, we do not want to give the same weight to each observation. For example, in computing a studentâs\\ngrade point average, we begin by setting values xi corresponding to grades ( A (cid:55)â 4, B (cid:55)â 3 and so on) and giving\\nweights w1, w2, . . . , wn equal to the number of units in a course.

For this reason, the mean is said to be sensitive to outliers while the median is not. To reduce the impact of\\nextreme outliers on the mean as a measure of center, we can also consider a truncated mean or trimmed mean. The\\np trimmed mean is obtained by discarding both the lower and the upper pÃ 100% of the data and taking the arithmetic\\nmean of the remaining data.\\nIn R, we write mean(x, trim = p) where p, a number between 0 and 0.5, is the fraction of observations to\\n\\nbe trimmed from each end before the mean is computed.\\n\\nNote that the median can be regarded as the 50% trimmed mean. The median does not change with a changes in\\nthe extreme observations. Such a property is called a resistant measure.

We shall soon learn the rationale for\\nthe decision to divide by n â 1. However, we shall also encounter circumstances in which division by n is preferable.\\nWe will routinely drop the subscript x and write s to denote standard deviation if there is no ambiguity.\\n\\nExample 2.7.

Flip a fair coin 16 times, recording the number of heads. Repeat this activity 20 times, giving x1, . . . , x20\\nheads. Our instincts say that the mean should be 8. Compute SS(8). Next ï¬nd Â¯x for the data you generated and\\ncompute SS(Â¯x). Notice that SS(8) > SS(Â¯x).\\n\\nNote that in repeating the experiment of ï¬ipping a fair coin 16 times and recording the number of heads, we would\\nlike to compute the variation about 8, the value that our intuition tells us is the true mean. In many circumstances, we\\ndo not have such intuition. Thus, we doing the best we can by computing Â¯x, the mean from the data. In this case, the\\nvariation about the sample mean is smaller than the variation about what may be called a true mean. Thus, division\\nof(cid:80)n\\ni=1(xi â Â¯x)2 by n systematically underestimates the variance. The deï¬nition of sample variance is based on the\\nfact that this can be compensated for this by dividing by something small than n. We will learn why the appropriate\\nchoice is n â 1 when we investigate Unbiased Estimation in Topic 13.\\n\\nTo show that the phenomena in Exercise 2.9 is true more broadly, we next perform a little algebra. This is similar\\nto the computation of the parallel axis theorem in physics. The parallel axis theorem is used to determine the moment\\nof inertia of a rigid body about any axis, given the moment of inertia of the object about the parallel axis through the\\nobjectâs center of mass (Â¯x) and the perpendicular distance between the axes. In this case, we a looking at the rigid\\nmotion of a ï¬nite number of equal point masses.\\n\\nIn the formula for SS(Î±), divide the difference in the value of each observation xi to the value Î± into the difference\\n\\nto the sample mean Â¯x and then the distance from the sample mean to Î± (i.e. Â¯x â Î±).\\n\\nSS(Î±) =\\n\\n=\\n\\nn(cid:88)i=1\\nn(cid:88)i=1\\n\\n(xi â Â¯x)2 +\\n\\nn(cid:88)i=1\\n\\n((xi â Â¯x) + (Â¯x â Î±))2 =\\n\\n(xi â Â¯x)2 + 2\\n\\nn(cid:88)i=1\\n\\n(xi â Â¯x)(Â¯x â Î±) +\\n\\nn(cid:88)i=1\\n\\n(Â¯x â Î±)2\\n\\n(Â¯x â Î±)2 =\\n\\n(xi â Â¯x)2 + n(Â¯x â Î±)2.\\n\\nn(cid:88)i=1\\nn(cid:88)i=1\\n\\n26\\n\\n\\x0cn(cid:88)i=1\\n\\nn(cid:88)i=1\\ni â nÂ¯x2(cid:33) .\\n\\nx2\\n\\nIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nDescribing Distributions with Numbers\\n\\nBy Exercise 2.8, the cross term above 2(cid:80)n\\n\\ni=1(xi â Â¯x)(Â¯x â Î±) equals to zero. Thus, we have partitioned the sums of\\nsquares into two levels. The ï¬rst term gives the sums of squares about the sample mean Â¯x. The second gives square of\\nthe difference between Â¯x and the chosen value Î±. We shall see this idea of partitioning in other contexts.\\n\\nNote that the minimum value of SS(Î±) can be obtained by minimizing the second term. This takes place at Î± = Â¯x.\\n\\nThus,\\n\\nmin\\n\\nÎ±\\n\\nSS(Î±) = SS(Â¯x) =\\n\\n(xi â Â¯x)2.\\n\\nOur second use for this identity provides an alternative method to compute the variance.

One way to\\ninclude more about this observation would be to give the value of the empirical cumulative distribution function.\\nThus,\\n\\nFn(87) = 0.7223\\n\\n27\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nDescribing Distributions with Numbers\\n\\ntells us that about 72% of the exam scores were below 87. This is sometimes reported by saying that 87 is the 0.7223\\nquantile for the exam scores.\\n\\nWe can determine this value using the R command quantile. For the ages of presidents at inauguration, we\\n\\nhave that the 72% quantile is 57 year old.\\n\\n> quantile(age,0.72)\\n72%\\n57\\n\\nThus, for example, for the ages of the president, we have that IQR(age) can also be computed using the command\\nquantile(age,3/4) - quantile(age,1/4). R returns the value 7. The quantile command on its own\\nreturns the ï¬ve number summary.\\n\\n0%\\n42\\n\\n25% 50% 75% 100%\\n70\\n\\n55\\n\\n51\\n\\n58\\n\\nAnother, and perhaps more common use of the term quantiles is a general term for partitioning ranked data into\\nequal parts. For example, quartiles partitions the data into 4 equal parts. Percentiles partitions the data into 100 equal\\nparts. Thus, the k-th q-tile is the value in the data for which k/q of the values are below the given value. This naturally\\nleads to some rounding issues which leads to a large variety of small differences in the deï¬nition of quantiles.\\n\\nExercise 2.12. For the example above, describe the quintile, decile, and percentile of the observation 87.\\n\\nA second way to evaluate a score of 87 is to related it to the mean. Thus, if the mean Â¯x = 76. Then, we might say\\nthat the exam score is 11 points above the mean. If the scores are quite spread out, then 11 points above the mean is\\njust a little above average. If the scores are quite tightly spread, then 11 points is quite a bit above average. Thus, for\\ncomparisons, we will sometimes use the standardized version of xi,\\n\\nzi =\\n\\nxi â Â¯x\\nsx\\n\\n.\\n\\nThe observations zi have mean 0 and standard deviation 1. The value zi is also called the standard score , the z-value,\\nthe z-score, and the normal score. An individual z-score, zi, gives the number of standard deviations an observation\\nxi is above (or below) the mean.\\n\\nThe R command scale transforms the data to the standard score. For the ages of the presidents, we use the scale\\ncommand to show the standardized ages. The head command show the ï¬rst 6 rows of the output for presidents from\\nGeorge Washington to John Qunicy Adams.\\n\\n> head(data.frame(scale(age),(age-mean(age))/sd(age)))\\n\\nscale.age.

What are the units of the standard score? What is the relationship of the standard score of an obser-\\nvation xi and yi = axi + b?\\n\\n2.4 Quantile-Quantile Plots\\nIn addition to side by side boxplots or histograms, we can also compare two cumulative distribution function directly\\nwith the quantile-quantile or Q-Q plot. If the quantitative data sets x and y have the same number of observations,\\n\\n28\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nDescribing Distributions with Numbers\\n\\nFigure 2.2: age of ï¬rst seizure (left) side-by-side boxplots, (center) empirical cumulative distribution functions, (right) Q-Q plot with Q1, the\\nmedian, and Q3 indicated by the solid red dots. The solid line on the plot has intercept 0 and slope 1. (missense age=nonsense age)\\n\\nthen this is simply plot(sort(x),sort(y)). In this case the Q-Q plot matches each of the quantiles for the two\\ndata sets. If the data sets have an unequal number of observations, then observations from the larger data are reduced\\nby interpolation to create data sets of equal length and the Q-Q plot is plot(sort(xred),sort(yred)) for the\\nreduced data sets xred and yred.\\n\\nExample 2.14. Dravet syndrome, also known as Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy of Infancy (SMEI), is a rare and catas-\\ntrophic form of intractable epilepsy that begins in infancy. A recent study looks at de novo mutations in the DNA\\nsequence SCN1A that codes for a sodium channel protein. An improperly functioning sodium channel can have severe\\nconsequences for brain function.\\n\\nThe two basic types of mutations under study are point mutations, called missense and nonsense mutations. A\\nmissense mutation results in a change in an amino acid in the SCN1A protein, whereas a nonsense mutation results in\\na truncated, incomplete, and usually nonfunctional protein segment that is degraded.\\n\\nHere is the age of ï¬rst seizure in a study of 264 Japanese children.

The ï¬rst of these, correlation, examines this relationship in a symmetric manner. The second, regression,\\nconsiders the relationship of a response variable as determined by one or more explanatory variables. Correlation\\nfocuses primarily on association, while regression is designed to help make predictions. Consequently, the ï¬rst does\\nnot attempt to establish any cause and effect. The second is a often used as a tool to establish causality.\\n\\n3.1 Covariance and Correlation\\nThe covariance measures the linear relation-\\nship between a pair of quantitative measures\\n\\nvectors\\n\\nquantitative\\nobservations\\n\\nx1, x2, . . . , xn\\n\\nand\\n\\ny1, y2, . . . , yn\\n\\non the same sample of n individuals.

From the discussion above, we can see\\nthat the scatterplot would lie on a straight line for the values r = Â±1.\\nFor the Archeopteryx data on bone lengths, we have the correlation\\n\\n> cor(femur, humerus)\\n[1] 0.9941486\\n\\nThus, the data land very nearly on a line with positive slope.\\nFor the banks in 1974, we have the correlation\\n\\n> cor(income,assets)\\n[1] 0.9325191\\n\\n36\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nCorrelation and Regression\\n\\n3.2 Linear Regression\\nCovariance and correlation are measures of linear association. For the Archeopteryx measurements, we learn that the\\nrelationship in the length of the femur and the humerus is very nearly linear.\\n\\nWe now turn to situations in which the value of the ï¬rst variable xi will be considered to be explanatory or\\npredictive. The corresponding output observation yi, taken from the input xi, is called the response. For example,\\ncan we explain or predict the income of banks from its assets? In this case, assets is the explanatory variable and\\nincome is the response.\\n\\nIn linear regression, the response variable is linearly related to the explanatory variable (also known as the co-\\n\\nvariate), but is subject to deviation, discrepency, or to error. We write\\n\\nyi = Î± + Î²xi + \\x01i.\\n\\n(3.5)\\n\\nOur goal is, given the data, the xiâs and yiâs, to ï¬nd Î± and Î² that determines the line having the best ï¬t to the\\ndata. The principle of least squares regression states that the best choice of this linear relationship is the one that\\nminimizes the square in the vertical distance from the y values in the data and the y values on the regression line. This\\nchoice reï¬ects the fact that the values of x are set by the experimenter and are thus assumed known. Thus, the âerrorâ\\nappears in the value of the response variable y.\\n\\nThis principle leads to a minimization problem for\\n\\nSS(Î±, Î²) =\\n\\n\\x012\\ni =\\n\\nn(cid:88)i=1\\n\\nn(cid:88)i=1\\n\\n(yi â (Î± + Î²xi))2.\\n\\n(3.6)\\n\\nIn other words, given the data, determine the values for Î± and Î² that minimizes the sum of squares SS. Letâs the\\ndenote by ËÎ± and ËÎ² the value for Î± and Î² that minimize SS.\\n\\nTake the partial derivative with respect to Î±.\\n\\nâ\\nâÎ±\\n\\nSS(Î±, Î²) = â2\\n\\n(yi â Î± â Î²xi)\\n\\nn(cid:88)i=1\\n\\nAt the values ËÎ± and ËÎ², this partial derivative is 0.

To emphasize this fact, we rewrite (3.5)\\n\\nin slope-point form.\\n\\nWe then apply this to the sums of squares criterion (3.6) to obtain a condition that depends on Î²,\\n\\nyi â Â¯y = Î²(xi â Â¯x) + \\x01i.\\n\\nËSS(Î²) =\\n\\n\\x012\\ni =\\n\\nn(cid:88)i=1\\n\\nn(cid:88)i=1\\n\\n((yi â Â¯y) â Î²(xi â Â¯x))2.\\n\\nNow, differentiate with respect to Î² and set this equation to zero for the value ËÎ².\\n\\n(3.8)\\n\\n(3.9)\\n\\nd\\ndÎ²\\n\\nËSS(Î²) = â2\\n\\nn(cid:88)i=1\\n\\n((yi â Â¯y) â ËÎ²(xi â Â¯x))(xi â Â¯x) = 0.\\n\\n37\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nCorrelation and Regression\\n\\nThus,\\n\\nn(cid:88)i=1\\nn(cid:88)i=1\\n\\n1\\n\\nn â 1\\n\\nn(cid:88)i=1\\n\\n1\\n\\n(yi â Â¯y)(xi â Â¯x) = ËÎ²\\n\\n(xi â Â¯x)2\\n\\n(yi â Â¯y)(xi â Â¯x) = ËÎ²\\n\\nn â 1\\ncov(x, y) = ËÎ²var(x)\\n\\nNow solve for ËÎ².\\n\\nIn summary, to determine the regression line.\\n\\nËÎ² =\\n\\ncov(x, y)\\nvar(x)\\n\\n.\\n\\nËyi = ËÎ± + ËÎ²xi,\\n\\nn(cid:88)i=1\\n\\n(xi â Â¯x)2\\n\\n(3.10)\\n\\nwe use (3.10) to determine ËÎ² and then (3.7) to solve for\\n\\nËÎ± = Â¯y â ËÎ² Â¯x.\\n\\nWe call Ëyi the ï¬t for the value xi.\\n\\nNotice that the units of Î± (and ËÎ±) are the same as the units of the response variable, y.

For the 1974 bank data set, the regression line\\n\\n(cid:92)income = 7.680 + 4.975 Â· assets.\\n\\nSo, each dollar in assets brings in about $5 income.\\n\\nFor a bank having 10 billion dollars in assets, the predicted income is 56.430 billion dollars. However, if we\\nextrapolate this down to very small banks, we would predict nonsensically that a bank with no assets would have\\nan income of 7.68 billion dollars. This illustrates the caution necessary to perform a reliable prediction through an\\nextrapolation.\\n\\nIn addition for this data set, we see that three banks have assets much greater than the others. Thus, we should con-\\nsider examining the regression lines omitting the information from these three banks. If a small number of observations\\nhas a large impact on our results, we call these points inï¬uential.\\n\\nObtaining the regression line in R is straightforward:\\n\\n> lm(incomeËassets)\\n\\nCall:\\nlm(formula = income Ë assets)\\n\\nCoefficients:\\n(Intercept)\\n7.680\\n\\nassets\\n4.975\\n\\nExample 3.12 (regression line in standardized coordinates).

If a man whose height is 0.5\\nstandard deviation below the mean, then we predict that the sonâs height is 0.3 standard deviations below the mean.\\nIn either case, our prediction for the son is a height that is closer to the mean then the fatherâs height. This is the\\nâregressionâ that Galton had in mind.\\nExercise 3.13. Compute the regression line for the 6 pairs of observations above assuming that y is the explanatory\\nvariable. Show that the two region lines differ by showing that the product of the slopes in not equal to one.\\nExercise 3.14. Create a scatterplot of the x and y variables with correlation r = 0.5 and place both the regression\\nlines on the scatter, Verify that they cross at (Â¯x, Â¯y).\\n\\nFrom the discussion above, we can see that if we reverse the role of the explanatory and response variable, then\\nwe change the regression line. This should be intuitively obvious since in the ï¬rst case, we are minimizing the total\\nsquare vertical distance and in the second, we are minimizing the total square horizontal distance. In the most extreme\\ncircumstance, cov(x, y) = 0. In this case, the value xi of an observation is no help in predicting the response variable.\\nThus, as the formula states, when x is the explanatory variable the regression line has slope 0 - it is a horizontal line\\nthrough Â¯y. Correspondingly, when y is the explanatory variable, the regression is a vertical line through Â¯x. Intuitively,\\nif x and y are uncorrelated, then the best prediction we can make for yi given the value of xi is just the sample mean\\nÂ¯y and the best prediction we can make for xi given the value of yi is the sample mean Â¯x.\\n\\nMore formally, the two regression equations are\\n\\nâ\\nâ\\ni = rx\\nËy\\ni\\n\\nand\\n\\nâ\\ni = ry\\n\\nâ\\ni .\\n\\nËx\\n\\nThese equations have slopes r and 1/r. This is shown by example in Figure 3.2.\\nExercise 3.15. Continuing the previous example, let ËÎ²x be the slope of the regression line obtained from regressing y\\non x and ËÎ²y be the slope of the regression line obtained from regressing x on y.

In this case we have,\\n\\ng(yi) = Î± + Î²Ï(xi) + \\x01i.\\n\\n(3.13)\\n\\nA common choice to to perform linear regression on the variables Ëy = g(y) and Ëx = Ï(x) using the least squares\\n\\ncriterion. In this case, g is called the link function\\n\\nFor example, if\\n\\nwe take logarithms,\\n\\nyi = Aekxi+\\x01i,\\n\\nln yi = ln A + kxi + \\x01i\\n\\nSo, in (3.13), the link function g(yi) = ln yi. The parameters are Î± = ln A and Î² = k.\\n\\nBefore we look at an example, letâs review a few basic properties of logarithms\\n\\nRemark 3.20 (logarithms). We will use both log, the base 10 common logarthm, and ln, the base e natural loga-\\nrithm. Common logarithms more readily help us see orders of magnitude. For example, if log y = 5, then we know\\nif log y = â1, then we know that y = 10â1 = 1/10. Typically, we will use natural\\nthat y = 105 = 100, 000.\\nlogarithms when we want to emphasize instantaneous rates of growth. To understand how this works, consider the\\ndifferential equation\\n\\ndy\\ndt\\n\\n= ky.\\n\\nWe are saying that the instantaneous rate of growth of y is proportional to y with constant of proportionality k. The\\nsolution to this equation is\\n\\ny = y0ekt\\n\\nor\\n\\nln y = ln y0 + kt\\n\\nwhere y0 is the initial value for y. This gives a linear relationship between ln y and t. The two values of logarithm\\nhave a simple relationship. If we write\\n\\nThus, by substituting for a, we ï¬nd that\\n\\nx = 10a. Then log x = a and ln x = a ln 10.\\n\\nln x = log x Â· ln 10 = 2.3026 log x.\\n\\nIn R, the command for the natural logarithm of x is log(x). For the common logarithm, it is log(x,10).\\n\\nExample 3.21. In the data on world oil production, the relationship between the explanatory variable and response\\nvariable is nonlinear but can be made to be linear with a simple transformation, the common logarithm. Call the new\\n\\n45\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nCorrelation and Regression\\n\\nresponse variable logbarrel. The explanatory variable remains year. With these variables, we can use a regression\\nline to help describe the data. Here the model is\\n\\nlog yi = Î± + Î²xi + \\x01i.\\n\\n(3.14)\\n\\nRegression is the ï¬rst example of a class of statistical models called linear models. At this point we emphasize that\\nlinear refers to the appearance of the parameters Î± and Î² linearly in the function (3.14). This acknowledges that, in\\nthis circumstance, the values xi and yi are known. Indeed, they are the data. Using the principle of least squares, our\\ngoal is to give an estimate using the principle of least squares to ËÎ± and ËÎ² for the values of Î± and Î².

This generally begins with some initial guess of parameter\\nvalues and an iteration scheme to minimize SS(Î²). Such a scheme is likely to use local information about the ï¬rst\\nand second partial derivatives of g with respect to the parameters Î²i. For example, gradient descent (also known\\nas steepest descent, or the method of steepest descent) is an iterative method in which produces a sequence of\\nparameter values. The increment of the parameter values for an iteration is proportional to the negative of the gradient\\nof SS(Î²) evaluated at the current point. The hope is that the sequence converges to give the desired minimum value\\nfor SS(Î²). The R command gnls for general nonlinear least squares is used to accomplish this. As above, you\\nshould examine the residual plot to see that it has no structure. For, example, if the Lineweaver-Burke method for\\nMichaelis-Mentens kinetics yields structure in the residuals, then linear regression is not considered a good method.\\nUnder these circumstances, one can next try to use the parameter estimates derived from Lineweaver-Burke as an\\ninitial guess in a nonlinear least squares regression using a least square criterion based on the sum of squares\\n\\nSS(Vmax, Km) =\\n\\nn(cid:88)j=1(cid:18)Vj â Vmax\\n\\n[S]j\\n\\nKm + [S]j(cid:19)2\\n\\nfor data (V1, [S]1), (V2, [S]2), . . .

Garï¬eld, December 16, 1867\\nOur health care is too costly; our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the\\nways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.\\n\\nThese are the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics. Less measurable but no less profound\\nis a sapping of conï¬dence across our land a nagging fear that Americaâs decline is inevitable, and that\\nthe next generation must lower its sights. - Barack Obama, January 20, 2009\\n\\n4.1 Preliminary Steps\\nMany questions begin with an anecdote or an unexplained occurrence in the lab or in the ï¬eld. This can lead to fact-\\nï¬nding interviews or easy to perform experimental assays. The next step will be to review the literature and begin\\nan exploratory data analysis often using publically available data. At this stage, we are looking, on the one hand,\\nfor patterns and associations, and, on the other hand, apparent inconsistencies occurring in the scientiï¬c literature.\\nNext we will examine the data using quantitative methods - summary statistics for quantitative variables, tables for\\ncategorical variables - and graphical methods - boxplots, histograms, scatterplots, time plots for quantitative data - bar\\ncharts for categorical data.\\n\\nThe strategy of these investigations is frequently the same - look at a sample in order to learn something about a\\n\\npopulation or to take a census or the total population.\\n\\nDesigns for producing data begin with some basic questions:\\n\\nâ¢ What can I measure?\\nâ¢ What shall I measure?\\nâ¢ How shall I measure it?\\nâ¢ How frequently shall I measure it?\\nâ¢ What obstacles do I face in obtaining a reliable measure?\\nThe frequent goal of a statistical study is to investigate the nature of causality. In this way we try to explain the\\nvalues of some response variables based on knowing the values of one or more explanatory variables. The major\\nissue is that the associated phenomena could be caused by a third, previously unconsidered factor, called a lurking\\nvariable or confounding variable.\\n\\nTwo approaches are generally used to mitigate the impact of confounding. The ï¬rst, primarily statistical, involves\\nsubdividing the population under study into smaller groups that are more similar. This subdivision is called cross\\n\\n65\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nProducing Data\\n\\ntabulation or stratiï¬cation. For human studies, this could mean subdivision by gender, by age, by economic class,\\nby geographic region, or by level of education. For laboratory, this could mean subdivision by temperature, by pH,\\nby length of incubation, or by concentration of certain compounds (e.g. ATP). For ï¬eld studies, this could mean\\nsubdivision by soil type, by average winter temperature or by total rainfall. Naturally, as the number of subgroups\\nincrease, the size of these groups can decrease to the point that chance effects dominate the data.\\n\\nThe second is mathematical or probabilistic modeling. These models often take the form of a mechanistic model\\n\\nthat takes into an account the variables in the cross tabulation and builds a parametric model.\\n\\nThe best methodologies, of course, make a comprehensive use of both of these types of approaches.\\n\\n4.2 Professional Ethics\\n\\nAs a citizen, we should participate in public discourse. Those with particular training have a special obligation to bring\\nto the public their special knowledge. Such public statements can take several forms. We can speak out as a member\\nof society with no particular basis in our area of expertise. We can speak out based on the wisdom that comes with this\\nspecialized knowledge. Finally, we can speak out based on a formal procedure of gathering information and reporting\\ncarefully the results of our analysis. In each case, it is our obligation to be clear about the nature of that communication\\nand that the our statements follow the highest ethical standards. In the same vein, as consumers of information, we\\nshould have a clear understanding of the perspective in any document that presents statistical information.\\n\\nProfessional statistical societies have provided documents that provide guidance on what can be sometimes be\\ndifï¬cult judgements and decisions. Two sources of guidance are the Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice from\\nthe American Statistical Society.\\n\\nhttp://www.amstat.org/about/ethicalguidelines.cfm\\n\\nand the International Statistical Institute Declaration on Professional Ethics\\n\\nhttp://www.isi-web.org/about-isi/professional-ethics\\n\\n4.3 Formal Statistical Procedures\\n\\nThe formal procedures that will be described in this section presume that we will have a sufï¬ciently well understood\\nmathematical model to support the analysis of data obtained under a given procedure. Thus, this section anticipates\\nsome of the concepts in probability theory like independence, conditional probability, distributions under different\\nsampling protocols and expected values. It also will rely fundamentally on some of the consequences of this theory\\nas seen, for example, in the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem. These are topics that we shall soon\\nexplore in greater detail.\\n\\n4.3.1 Observational Studies\\nThe goal is to learn about a population by observing a sample with as little disturbance as possible to the sample.\\n\\nSometimes the selection of treatments is not under the control of the researcher. For example, if we suspect that a\\ncertain mutation would render a virus more or less virulent, we cannot ethically perform the genetic engineering and\\ninfect humans with the viral strains.\\n\\nFor an observational study, effects are often confounded and thus causation is difï¬cult to assert. The link between\\nsmoking and a variety of diseases is one very well known example. We have seen the data set relating student smoking\\nhabits in Tucson to their parents. We can see that children of smokers are more likely to smoke. This is more easily\\ndescribed if we look at conditional distributions.\\n\\n66\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nProducing Data\\n\\n0 parents smoke\\n\\nstudent smokes\\n\\n0.1386\\n\\nstudent does not smoke\\n\\n0.8614\\n\\n1 parent smoke\\n\\nstudent smokes\\n\\n0.1858\\n\\nstudent does not smoke\\n\\n0.8142\\n\\n2 parents smoke\\n\\nstudent smokes\\n\\n0.2247\\n\\nstudent does not smoke\\n\\n0.7753\\n\\nTo display these conditional distributions in R:\\n\\n> smoking<-matrix(c(400,1380,416,1823,188,1168),ncol=3)\\n> smoking\\n\\n[,1] [,2] [,3]\\n[1,]\\n400 416 188\\n[2,] 1380 1823 1168\\n> condsmoke<-matrix(rep(0,6),ncol=3)\\n> for (i in 1:3)\\n\\n{condsmoke[,i]=smoking[,i]/sum(smoking[,i])}\\n\\n> colnames(condsmoke)\\n\\n<-c(\"2 parents\",\"1 parent\", \"0 parents\")\\n\\n> rownames(condsmoke)\\n\\n<-c(\"smokes\",\"does not smoke\")\\n\\n> condsmoke\\n\\n2 parents 1 parent 0 parents\\nsmokes\\n0.2247191 0.1857972 0.1386431\\ndoes not smoke 0.7752809 0.8142028 0.8613569\\n> barplot(condsmoke,legend=rownames(condsmoke))\\n\\nEven though we see a trend - children are more likely to smoke in households with parents who smoke, we cannot\\nassert causation, i.e., children smoke because their parents smoke. An alternative explanation might be, for example,\\npeople may have a genetic predisposition to smoking.\\n\\n4.3.2 Randomized Controlled Experiments\\nIn a controlled experiment, the researcher imposes a treatment on the experimental units or subjects in order to\\nobserve a response. Great care and knowledge must be given to the design of an effective experiment. A University\\nof Arizona study on the impact of diet on cancers in women had as its goal speciï¬c recommendations on diet. Such\\nrecommendations were set to encourage lifestyle changes for millions of American women. Thus, enormous effort\\nwas taken in the design of the experiment so that the research team was conï¬dent in its results.\\n\\nA good experimental design is one that is based on a solid understanding of both the science behind the study and\\nthe probabilistic tools that will lead to the inferential techniques used for the study. This study is often set to assess\\nsome hypothesis - Do parents smoking habits inï¬uence their children? or estimate some value - What is the mean\\nlength of a given strain of bacteria?\\n\\nPrinciples of Experimental Design\\n\\n1. Control for the effects of lurking variables by comparing several treatments.\\n\\n67\\n\\n2 parents1 parent0 parentsdoes not smokesmokes0.00.20.40.60.81.01.2\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nProducing Data\\n\\n2. Randomize the assignment of subjects to treatments to eliminate bias due to systematic differences among\\n\\ncategories.\\n\\n3. Replicate the experiment on many subjects to reduce the impact of chance variation on the results.\\n\\nIssues with Control\\nThe desired control can sometimes be quite difï¬cult to achieve. For example;\\n\\nâ¢ In medical trials, some individuals may display a placebo effect, the favorable response to any treatment.\\nâ¢ Overlooking or introducing a lurking variable can introduce a hidden bias.\\nâ¢ The time and money invested can lead to a subconscious effect by the experimenter. Use an appropriate blind\\nor double blind procedure. In this case, neither the experimenter nor the subject are aware of which treatment\\nis being used.\\n\\nâ¢ Changes in the wording of questions can lead to different outcomes.\\nâ¢ Transferring discoveries from the laboratory to a genuine living situation can be difï¬cult to make.\\nâ¢ The data may suffer from undercoverage of difï¬cult to ï¬nd groups. For example, mobile phone users are less\\n\\naccessible to pollsters.\\n\\nâ¢ Some individuals leave the experimental group, especially in longitudinal studies.\\nâ¢ In some instances, a control is not possible. The outcomes of the absence of the enactment of an economic\\npolicy, for example, a tax cut or economic stimulus plan, cannot be directly measured. Thus, economists are\\nlikely to use a mathematical model of different policies and examine the outcomes of computer simulations as a\\nproxy for control.\\n\\nâ¢ Social desirability bias describes the tendency of survey respondents to answer questions in a manner that will\\nbe viewed favorably by others. Thus surveys on medical issues, religious practices, sexual practices, political\\npreferences, personal achievement typically use specialized techniques to obtain more truthful responses. The\\nBradley effect is a theory proposed to explain observed discrepancies between voter opinion polls and election\\noutcomes in some US government elections where a white candidate and a non-white candidate run against each\\nother. The theory proposes that some voters tend to tell pollsters that they are undecided or likely to vote for\\na black candidate, and yet, on election day, vote for his white opponent. It was named after Tom Bradley, an\\nAfrican-American who lost the 1982 California governorâs race despite being ahead in voter polls going into the\\nelections.\\n\\nSetting a Design\\nBefore data are collected, we must consider some basic questions:\\nâ¢ Decide on the number of explanatory variables or factors.\\nâ¢ Decide on the values or levels that will be used in the treatment.\\n\\nExample 4.1. For over a century, beekeepers have attempted to breed honey bees belonging to different races to take\\nadvantage of the effects of hybrid vigor to create a better honey producer. No less a ï¬gure than Gregor Mendel failed\\nin this endeavor because he could not control the matings of queens and drones.\\n\\nA more recent failure, a breeding experiment using African and European bees, occurred in 1956 in an apiary\\nin the southeast of Brazil. The hybrid Africanized honey bees escaped, and today, in the western hemisphere, all\\nAfricanized honey bees are descended from the 26 Tanzanian queen bees that resided in this apiary. By the mid-1990s,\\nAfricanized bees have spread to Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Florida and southern California.\\n\\n68\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nProducing Data\\n\\nWhen the time arrives for replacing the mother queen in a colony (a process known as supercedure), the queen\\nwill lay about ten queen eggs. The ï¬rst queen that completes her development and emerges from her cell is likely to\\nbecome the next queen. Suppose we have chosen to investigate the question of whether a shorter time for development\\nfor Africanized bee queens than for the resident European bee queens is the mechanism behind the replacement by\\nAfricanized subspecies in South and Central American and in the southwestern United States. The development time\\nwill depend upon hive temperature, so we will determine a range of hive temperatures by looking through the literature\\nand making a few of our own measurements. From this, we will set a cool, medium, and warm hive temperature. We\\nwill use European honey bee (EHB) queens as a control. Thus, we have two factors.\\n\\nâ¢ Queen type - European or Africanized\\nâ¢ Hive temperature - cool, medium, or warm.\\nThus, this experiment has 6 treatment groups.\\n\\nFactor B: hive temperature\\n\\ncool\\n\\nmedium\\n\\nwarm\\n\\nFactor A:\\ngenotype\\n\\nAHB\\n\\nEHB\\n\\nThe response variable is the queen development time - the length of time from the depositing of the egg from the\\nmother queen to the time that the daughter queen emerges from the hive. The immature queen is kept in the hive to be\\nfed during the egg and larval stages. At that point the cell containing the larval queen is capped by the worker bees.\\nThe experimenter then transfers the cell to an incubator for the pupal stage. The hive where the egg is laid and the\\nincubator that houses the queen is checked using a remote camera so that we have an accurate measure of the queen\\ndevelopment time.\\n\\nFor our experimental design, we will rear 120 queens altogether and use 20 in each treatment group. A few queens\\nare chosen and their genotypes are determined to verify the genetic designations of the groups. To reduce hidden\\nbiases, the queens in the incubator are labeled in such a way that their genotype is unknown. The determination\\nhow the number of samples in the study is necessary to have the desired conï¬dence in our results is called a power\\nanalysis. We will investigate this aspect of experimental design when we study hypothesis testing.\\n\\nRandom Samples\\nA simple random sample (SRS) of size n consists of n individuals chosen in such a way that every set of n individuals\\nhas an equal chance to be in the sample actually selected. This is easy to accomplish in R. First, give labels to the\\nindividuals in the population and then use the command sample to make the random choice. For the experiment\\nabove, we rear 90 Africanized queens and choose a sample of 60. (Placing the command in parenthesis calls on R to\\nprint the output.)\\n\\n69\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nProducing Data\\n\\n> population<-1:90\\n> (subjects<-sample(population,60))\\n\\n[1] 61 16 65 73 13 25 10 82 24 62 28 66 55\\n\\n[25] 87 68 22 11 5 48 33 63 50 88 35 37 84 12\\n[49] 78 49 45 7 64 3 42 57 81 56 46 32\\n\\n4 59 90 86\\n\\n8 26 72 67 17 58 69\\n\\n6 27 41 20\\n2 60 19 18 74 23\\n\\nIf your experimental design call for grouping similar individuals, called strata, then a stratiï¬ed random sample\\nfrom the full sample by choosing a separate random sample from each stratum. If one or more of the groups forms\\na small fraction of the population, then a stratiï¬ed random sample ensures the desired number of sample from these\\ngroups is included in the sample.\\n\\nIf we mark the 180 queens 1 through 180 with 1 through 90 being Africanized bees and 91 through 180 being\\n\\nEuropean, then we can enter\\n\\n> population<-1:180\\n> subjectsAHB<-sample(population[1:90],60)\\n> subjectsEHB<-sample(population[91:180],60)\\n\\nto ensure that 60 come from each group.\\n\\nFor the example above, we divide the sampled Africanized queens into 3 treatment groups based on hive tempera-\\nture.

This action had a variety of consequences\\nfrom reduced car accidents to the economic impact of longer times for the transportation of goods.

Here we highlight two very important examples.\\n\\n72\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nProducing Data\\n\\nLight: Its Speed and Medium of Propagation\\n\\nFor many centuries before the seventeenth, a debate continued as to whether light travelled instantaneously or at\\na ï¬nite speed. In ancient Greece, Empedocles maintained that light was something in motion, and therefore must\\ntake some time to travel. Aristotle argued, to the contrary, that âlight is due to the presence of something, but it is\\nnot a movement.â Euclid and Ptolemy advanced the emission theory of vision, where light is emitted from the eye.\\nConsequently, Heron of Alexandria argued, the speed of light must be inï¬nite because distant objects such as stars\\nappear immediately upon opening the eyes.\\n\\nIn 1021, Islamic physicist Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) published the Book of Optics, in which he used experiments\\nrelated to the camera obscura to support the now accepted intromission theory of vision, in which light moves from\\nan object into the eye. This led Alhazen to propose that light must therefore have a ï¬nite speed. In 1574, the Ottoman\\nastronomer and physicist Taqi al-Din also concluded that the speed of light is ï¬nite, correctly explained refraction as\\nthe result of light traveling more slowly in denser bodies, and suggested that it would take a long time for light from\\ndistant stars to reach the Earth. In the early 17th century, Johannes Kepler believed that the speed of light was inï¬nite\\nsince empty space presents no obstacle to it.\\n\\nIn 1638, Galileo Galilei ï¬nally proposed an experiment to mea-\\nsure the speed of light by observing the delay between uncovering\\na lantern and its perception some distance away. In 1667, Galileoâs\\nexperiment was carried out by the Accademia del Cimento of Flo-\\nrence with the lanterns separated by about one mile. No delay was\\nobserved. The experiment was not well designed and led to the con-\\nclusion that if light travel is not instantaneous, it is very fast. A\\nmore powerful experimental design to estimate of the speed of light\\nwas made in 1676 by Ole Christensen Romer, one of a group of\\nastronomers of the French Royal Academy of Sciences. From his\\nobservations, the periods of Jupiterâs innermost moon Io appeared\\nto be shorter when the earth was approaching Jupiter than when re-\\nceding from it, Romer concluded that light travels at a ï¬nite speed,\\nand was able to estimate that would it take light 22 minutes to cross\\nthe diameter of Earthâs orbit. Christiaan Huygens combined this es-\\ntimate with an estimate for the diameter of the Earthâs orbit to obtain\\nan estimate of speed of light of 220,000 km/s, 26% lower than the\\nactual value.\\n\\nWith the ï¬nite speed of light established, nineteenth century\\nphysicists, noting that both water and sound waves required a\\nmedium for propagation, postulated that the vacuum possessed a âlu-\\nminiferous aetherâ, the medium for light waves. Because the Earth\\nis in motion, the ï¬ow of aether across the Earth should produce a\\ndetectable âaether windâ. In addition, because the Earth is in orbit\\nabout the Sun and the Sun is in motion relative to the center of the\\nMilky Way, the Earth cannot remain at rest with respect to the aether\\nat all times. Thus, by analysing the speed of light in different di-\\nrections at various times, scientists could measure the motion of the\\nEarth relative to the aether.\\n\\nIn order to detect aether ï¬ow, Albert Michelson designed a light\\ninterferometer sending a single source of white light through a half-\\nsilvered mirror that split the light into two beams travelling at right\\nangles to one another. The split beams were recombined producing\\na pattern of constructive and destructive interference based on the travel time in transit.\\nIf the Earth is traveling\\nthrough aether, a beam reï¬ecting back and forth parallel to the ï¬ow of ether would take longer than a beam reï¬ecting\\nperpendicular to the aether because the time gained from traveling with the aether is less than that lost traveling against\\n\\nFigure 4.1: Romerâs diagram of Jupiter (B) eclipsing its\\nmoon Io (DC) as viewed from different points in earthâs\\norbit around the sun\\n\\n73\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nProducing Data\\n\\nthe ether. The result would be a delay in one of the light beams that could be detected by their interference patterns\\nresulting for the recombined beams. Any slight change in the travel time would then be observed as a shift in the\\npositions of the interference fringes. While Michaelsonâs prototype apparatus showed promise, it produced far too\\nlarge experimental errors.\\n\\nIn 1887, Edward Morley joined the effort to create a new device with enough accuracy to detect the aether wind.\\nThe new apparatus had a longer path length, it was built on a block of marble, ï¬oated in a pool of mercury, and located\\nin a closed room in the basement of a stone building to eliminate most thermal and vibrational effects. The mercury\\npool allowed the device to be turned, so that it could be rotated through the entire range of possible angles to the\\nhypothesized aether wind. Their results were the ï¬rst strong evidence against the aether theory and formed a basic\\ncontribution to the foundation of the theory of relativity. Thus, two natural questions - how fast does light travel and\\ndoes it need a medium - awaited elegant and powerful experiments to achieve the understanding we have today and\\nset the stage for the theory of relatively, one of the two great theories of modern physics.\\n\\nPrinciples of Inheritance and Genetic Material\\n\\nPatterns of inheritance have been noticed for millenia. Because of the needs for food, domesticated plants and animals\\nhave been bred according to deliberate patterns for at least 5000 years. Progress towards the discovery of the laws\\nfor inheritance began with a good set of model organisms. For example, annual ï¬owering plants had certainly been\\nused successfully in the 18th century by Josef Gottlieb KÂ¨olreuter. His experimental protocols took the advantage of\\nthe fact that these plants are easy to grow, have short generation times, have individuals that possess both male and\\nfemale reproductive organs, and have easily controlled mating through artiï¬cial pollination. KÂ¨olreuter established a\\nprinciple of equal parental contribution. The nature of inheritance remained unknown with a law of blending becoming\\na leading hypothesis. Indeed, Charles Darwin adopted this rationale, calling it pangenesis.\\n\\nIn the 1850s and 1860s, the Austrian monk Gregor Mendel used pea plants to work out the basic principles of\\ngenetics as we understand them today. Through careful inbreeding, Mendel found 7 true-breeding traits - traits that\\nremained present through many generations and persisted from parent to offspring. By this process, Mendel was sure\\nthat potential parent plants were from a true-breeding strain. Mendelâs explanatory variables were the traits of the\\nparental generation, G. His response variables were the traits of the individual plants in the ï¬rst ï¬lial generation,\\nF1 and second ï¬lial generation, F2.\\n\\nMendel noted that only one trait was ever ex-\\npressed in the F1 generation and called it domi-\\nnant. The alternative trait was called recessive.\\nThe most striking result is that in the F2 generation\\nthe fraction expressing the dominant trait was very\\nclose to 3/4 for each of the seven traits. (See the\\ntable below summarizing Mendelâs data.) These\\nresults in showing no intermediate traits disprove\\nthe blending hypothesis. Also, the blending theory\\ncould not explain the appearance of a pea plant ex-\\npressing the recessive trait that is the offspring of\\ntwo plants each expressing the dominant trait. This\\nlead to the hypothesis that each plant has two units\\nof inheritance and transmits one of them to each of\\nits offspring. Mendel could check this hypothesis by crossing, in modern terms, heterozygous plants with those that\\nare dominant homozygous. Mendel went on to examine the situation in which two traits are examined simultaneously\\nand showed that the two traits sort independently. We now use the squares devised in 1905 by Reginald Punnett to\\ncompute the probabilities of a particular cross or breeding experiment.\\n\\nFigure 4.2: Mendelâs traits and experiments.\\n\\n74\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nProducing Data\\n\\nparental phenotypes\\n\\ndominant\\n\\nrecessive\\n\\nspherical seeds Ã wrinkled seeds\\nyellow seeds Ã green seeds\\npurple ï¬owers Ã white ï¬owers\\ninï¬ated pods Ã constricted pods\\ngreen pods Ã yellow pods\\naxial ï¬owers Ã terminal ï¬owers\\ntall stems Ã dwarf stems\\n\\nF2 generation phenotypes\\nrecessive\\ndominant\\n1850\\n5474\\n6022\\n2001\\n224\\n705\\n299\\n882\\n152\\n428\\n207\\n651\\n787\\n277\\n\\ntotal\\n7324\\n8023\\n929\\n1181\\n580\\n858\\n1064\\n\\nfraction dominant\\n\\n0.747\\n0.751\\n0.758\\n0.747\\n0.738\\n0.759\\n0.740\\n\\nWe now know that many traits whose expression depends on environment can vary continuously. We can also see\\nthat some genes are linked by their position and do not sort independently. (A pea plant has 7 pairs of chromosomes.)\\nThe effects can sometimes look like blending. But thanks to Mendelâs work, we can see how these expressions are\\nbuilt from the expression of several genes.\\n\\nNow we know that inheritance is given in âpacketsâ. The next question is what material in the living cell is\\nthe source of inheritance. Theodor Boveri using sea urchins and Walter Sutton using grasshoppers independently\\ndeveloped the chromosome theory of inheritance in 1902. From their work, we know that all the chromosomes\\nhad to be present for proper embryonic development and that chromosomes occur in matched pairs of maternal and\\npaternal chromosomes which separate during meiosis. Soon thereafter, Thomas Hunt Morgan, working with the fruit\\nï¬y Drosophila melanogaster as a model system, noticed that a mutation resulting in white eyes was linked to sex - only\\nmales had white eyes. Microscopy revealed a dimorphism in the sex chromosome and with this information, Morgan\\ncould predict the inheritance of sex linked traits. Morgan continued to learn that genes must reside on a particular\\nchromosomes.\\n\\nWe now think of chromosomes as composed of\\nDNA, but it is in reality an organized structure of DNA\\nand protein. Thus, which of the two formed the in-\\nheritance material was in doubt. Phoebus Levene, who\\nidentiï¬ed the components of DNA, declared that it could\\nnot store the genetic code because it was chemically far\\ntoo simple. At that time, DNA was wrongly thought to\\nbe made up of regularly repeated tetranucleotides and\\nso could not be the carrier of genetic information. In-\\ndeed, in 1944 when Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and\\nMaclyn McCarty found that DNA to be the substance\\nthat causes bacterial transformation, the scientiï¬c com-\\nmunity was reluctant to accept the result despite the care\\ntaken in the experiments. These researchers considered\\nseveral organic molecules - proteins, nucleic acids, car-\\nbohydrates, and lipids.\\nIn each case, if the DNA was\\ndestroyed, the ability to continue heritability ended.\\n\\nAlfred Hershey and Martha Chase\\n\\ncontinued the\\nsearch for the genetic material with an experiment using\\nbacteriophage. This virus that infects bacteria is made\\nup of liitle more than DNA inside a protein shell. The\\nvirus introduces material into the bacterium that co-opts\\nthe host, producing dozens of viruses that emerge from the lysed bacterium. Their experiment begins with growing\\none culture of phage in a medium containing radioactive phosphorus (that appears in DNA but not in proteins) and\\nanother culture in a medium containing radioactive sulfur (that appears in proteins but not in DNA). Afterwards they\\nagitated the bacteria in a blender to strip away the parts of the virus that did not enter the cell in a way that does\\nminimal damage to the bacteria. They then isolated the bacteria ï¬nding that the sulfur separated from the bacteria and\\nthat the phosphorus had not. By 1952 when Hershey and Chase conï¬rmed that DNA was the genetic material with\\n\\n75\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nProducing Data\\n\\ntheir experiment using bacteriophage, scientists were more prepared to accept the result. This, of course, set the stage\\nfor the importance of the dramatic discovery by Watson, Crick, and Franklin of the double helix structure of DNA.\\n\\nAgain, for both of these fundamental discoveries, the principles of inheritance and DNA as the carrier of inheritance\\ninformation, the experimental design was key. In the second case, we learned that even though Avery, MacLeod, and\\nMcCarty had designed their experiment well, they did not, at that time, have a scientiï¬c community prepared to\\nacknowledge their ï¬ndings.\\n\\nSalk Vaccine Field Trials\\nPoliomyelitis, often called polio or infantile paral-\\nysis, is an acute viral infectious disease spread\\nfrom person to person, primarily via the fecal-oral\\nroute. The overwhelming majority of polio infec-\\ntions have no symptoms. However, if the virus en-\\nters the central nervous system, it can infect motor\\nneurons, leading to symptoms ranging from mus-\\ncle weakness and paralysis. The effects of polio\\nhave been known since prehistory; Egyptian paint-\\nings and carvings depict otherwise healthy people\\nwith withered limbs, and children walking with\\ncanes at a young age. The ï¬rst US epidemic was\\nin 1916. By 1950, polio had claimed hundreds of\\nthousands of victims, mostly children.\\n\\nIn 1950, the Public Health Service (PHS) orga-\\nnized a ï¬eld trial of a vaccine developed by Jonas\\nSalk.\\n\\nPolio is an epidemic disease with\\nâ¢ 60,000 cases in 1952, and\\nâ¢ 30,000 cases in 1953.\\nSo, a low incidence without control could mean\\nâ¢ the vaccine works, or\\nâ¢ no epidemic in 1954.\\nSome basic facts were known before the trial started:\\nâ¢ Higher income parents are more likely to consent to allow children to take the vaccine.\\nâ¢ Children of lower income parents are thought to be less susceptible to polio. The reasoning is that these children\\nlive in less hygienic surroundings and so are more likely to contract very mild polio and consequently more\\nlikely to have polio antibodies.\\n\\nTo reduce the role of chance variation dominating the results, the United States Public Health Service (PHS)\\ndecided on a study group of two million people. At the same time, a parents advocacy group, the National Foundation\\nfor Infantile Paralysis (NFIP) set out its own design. Here are the essential features of the NFIP design:\\n\\nâ¢ Vaccinate all grade 2 children with parental consent.\\nâ¢ Use grades 1 and 3 as controls.\\nThis design fails to have some of essential features of the principles of experimental design. Here is a critique:\\n\\n76\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nProducing Data\\n\\nâ¢ Polio spreads through contact, so infection of one child in a class can spread to the classmates.\\nâ¢ The treatment group is biased towards higher income.\\nThus, the treatment group and the control group have several differences beyond the fact that the treatment group\\nreceives the vaccine and the control group does not. This leaves the design open to having lurking variables be the\\nprimary cause in the differences in outcomes between the treatment and control groups. The Public Health Service\\ndesign is intended to take into account these shortcomings. Their design has the following features:\\n\\nâ¢ Flip a coin for each child. (randomized control)\\nâ¢ Children in the control group were given an injection of salt water. (placebo)\\nâ¢ Diagnosticians were not told whether a child was in treatment or control group. (double blind)\\nThe results:\\n\\nPHS\\n\\nSize\\n\\nTreatment\\nControl\\nNo consent\\n\\n200,000\\n200,000\\n350,000\\n\\nNFIP\\n\\nSize\\n\\n225,000\\n725,000\\n125,000\\n\\nRate\\n25\\n54\\n44\\n\\nRate\\n28\\n71\\n46\\n\\nRates are per 100,000\\n\\nWe shall learn later that the evidence is overwhelming that the vaccine reduces the risk of contracting polio. As a\\nconsequence of the study, universal vaccination was undertaken in the United States in the early 1960s. A global effort\\nto eradicate polio began in 1988, led by the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and The Rotary Foundation. These\\nefforts have reduced the number of annual diagnosed from an estimated 350,000 cases in 1988 to 1,310 cases in 2007.\\nStill, polio persists. The world now has four polio endemic countries - Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India. One\\ngoal of the Gates Foundation is to eliminate polio.\\n\\nThe National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis was founded in 1938 by Franklin D. Roosevelt. Roosevelt was\\ndiagnosed with polio in 1921, and left him unable to walk. The Foundation is now known as the March of Dimes.\\nThe expanded mission of the March of Dimes is to improve the health of babies by preventing birth defects, premature\\nbirth and infant mortality. Its initiatives include rubella (German measles) and pertussis (whooping cough) vaccination,\\nmaternal and neonatal care, folic acid and spin biï¬da, fetal alcohol syndrome, newborn screening, birth defects and\\nprematurity.\\n\\nThe INCAP Study\\nThe World Health Organization cites malnutrition as the gravest single threat to the worldâs\\npublic health. Improving nutrition is widely regarded as the most effective form of aid. Ac-\\ncording to Jean Ziegler (the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food from\\n2000 to 2008) mortality due to malnutrition accounted for 58% of the total mortality in 2006.\\nIn that year, more than 36 million died of hunger or diseases due to deï¬ciencies in micronu-\\ntrients.\\n\\nMalnutrition is by far the biggest contributor to child mortality, present in half of all cases.\\nUnderweight births and inter-uterine growth restrictions cause 2.2 million child deaths a year.\\nPoor or non-existent breastfeeding causes another 1.4 million. Other deï¬ciencies, such as\\nlack of vitamins or minerals, for example, account for 1 million deaths. According to The\\nLancet, malnutrition in the ï¬rst two years is irreversible. Malnourished children grow up with\\nworse health and lower educational achievements.\\n\\nThus, understanding the root causes of malnutrition and designing remedies is a major\\nglobal health care imperative. As the next example shows, not every design sufï¬ciently con-\\nsiders the necessary aspects of human behavior to allow for a solid conclusion.\\n\\n77\\n\\nFigure 4.3: The orange\\nribbon is often used as\\na\\npromote\\nawareness of malnutrition,\\n\\nsymbol\\n\\nto\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nProducing Data\\n\\nThe Instituto de NutriciÂ´on de Centro Americo y Panama (INCAP) conducted a study on the effects of malnutrition.\\nThis 1969 study took place in Guatemala and was administered by the World Health Organization, and supported by\\nthe United States National Institute of Health.\\n\\nGrowth deï¬ciency is thought to be mainly due to protein deï¬ciency. Here are some basic facts known in advance\\n\\nof the study:\\n\\nâ¢ Guatemalan children eat 2/3 as much as children in the United States.\\nâ¢ Age 7 Guatemalan children are, on average, 5 inches shorter and 11 pounds lighter than children in the United\\n\\nStates.\\n\\nWhat are the confounding factors that might explain these differences?\\nâ¢ Genetics\\nâ¢ Prevalence of disease\\nâ¢ Standards of hygiene.\\nâ¢ Standards of medical care.\\nThe experimental design: Measure the effects in four very similar Guatemalan villages. Here are the criterion used\\n\\nfor the Guatemalan villages chosen for the study..\\n\\nâ¢ The village size is 150 families, 700 inhabitants with 100 under 6 years of age.\\nâ¢ The village is culturally Latino and not Mayan\\nâ¢ Village life consists of raising corn and beans for food and tomatoes for cash.\\nâ¢ Income is approximately $200 for a family of ï¬ve.\\nâ¢ The literacy rate is approximately 30% for individuals over age 7.\\nFor the experiment:\\nâ¢ Two villages received the treatment, a drink called atole, rich in calories and protein.\\nâ¢ Two villages received the control, a drink called fresca, low in calories and no protein.\\nâ¢ Both drinks contain missing vitamins and trace elements. The drinks were served at special cafeterias. The\\n\\namount consumed by each individual was recorded, but the use of the drinks was unrestricted.\\n\\nâ¢ Free medical care was provided to compensate for the burden on the villagers.\\nThe lack of control in the amount of the special drink consumed resulted in enormous variation in consumption.\\nIn particular, much more fresca was consumed. Consequently, the design fails in that differences beyond the speciï¬c\\ntreatment and control existed among the four villages.\\n\\nThe researchers were able to salvage some useful information from the data. They found a linear relationship\\n\\nbetween a childâs growth and the amount of protein consumed:\\n\\nchildâs growth rate = 0.04 inches/pound protein\\n\\nNorth American children consume an extra 100 pounds of protein by age 7. Thus, the protein accounts for 4 of the\\n\\n5 inches in the average difference in heights between Latino Guatemalans and Americans.\\n\\n78\\n\\n\\x0cPart II\\n\\nProbability\\n\\n79\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0cTopic 5\\n\\nThe Basics of Probability\\n\\nThe theory of probability as mathematical discipline can and should be developed from axioms in exactly\\nthe same way as Geometry and Algebra. - Andrey Kolmogorov, 1933, Foundations of the Theory of\\nProbability\\n\\n5.1 Introduction\\nMathematical structures like Euclidean geometry or algebraic ï¬elds are deï¬ned by a set of axioms. âMathematical\\nrealityâ is then developed through the introduction of concepts and the proofs of theorems. These axioms are inspired,\\nin the instances introduced above, by our intuitive understanding, for example, of the nature of parallel lines or the\\nreal numbers. Probability is a branch of mathematics based on three axioms inspired originally by calculating chances\\nfrom card and dice games.\\n\\nStatistics, in its role as a facilitator of science, begins with the collection of data. From this collection, we are\\nasked to make inference on the state of nature, that is to determine the conditions that are likely to produce these data.\\nProbability, in undertaking the task of investigating differing states of nature, takes the complementary perspective. It\\nbegins by examining random phenomena, i.e., those whose exact outcomes are uncertain. Consequently, in order to\\ndetermine the âscientiï¬c realityâ behind the data, we must spend some time working with the concepts of the theory\\nof probability to investigate properties of the data arising from the possible states of nature to assess which are most\\nuseful in making inference.\\n\\nWe will motivate the axioms of probability through the case of equally likely outcomes for some simple games of\\nchance and look at some of the direct consequences of the axioms. In order to extend our ability to use the axioms, we\\nwill learn counting techniques, e.g, permutations and combinations, based on the fundamental principle of counting.\\n\\nA probability model has two essential pieces of its description.\\nâ¢ â¦, the sample space, the set of possible outcomes.\\n\\nâ An event is a collection of outcomes. We can deï¬ne an event by explicitly giving its outcomes,\\n\\nA = {Ï1, Ï2,Â·Â·Â· , Ïn}\\n\\nor with a description\\n\\nIn either case, A is subset of the sample space, A â â¦.\\n\\nA = {Ï; Ï has property P}.\\n\\nâ¢ P , the probability assigns a number to each event.\\n\\n81\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nThe Basics of Probability\\n\\nThus, a probability is a function. We are familiar with functions in which both the domain and range are subsets of the\\nreal numbers. The domain of a probability function is the collection of all events. The range is still a number. We will\\nsee soon which numbers we will accept as probabilities of events.\\n\\nYou may recognize these concepts from a basic introduction to sets. In talking about sets, we use the term universal\\nset instead of sample space, element instead of outcome, and subset instead of event. At ï¬rst, having two words for\\nthe same concept seems unnecessarily redundant. However, we will later consider more complex situations which will\\ncombine ideas from sets and from probability. In these cases, having two expression for a concept will facilitate our\\nunderstanding. A Set Theory - Probability Theory Dictionary is included at the end of this topic to relate to the new\\nprobability terms with the more familiar set theory terms.\\n\\n5.2 Equally Likely Outcomes and the Axioms of Probability\\nThe essential relationship between events and the probability are described through the three axioms of probability.\\nThese axioms can be motivated through the ï¬rst uses of probability, namely the case of equal likely outcomes.\\n\\nIf â¦ is a ï¬nite sample space, then if each outcome is equally likely, we deï¬ne the probability of A as the fraction of\\noutcomes that are in A. Using #(A) to indicate the number of elements in an event A, this leads to a simple formula\\n\\nThus, computing P (A) means counting the number of outcomes in the event A and the number of outcomes in the\\n\\nsample space â¦ and dividing.\\n\\nP (A) =\\n\\n#(A)\\n#(â¦)\\n\\n.\\n\\nExercise 5.1. Find the probabilities under equal likely outcomes.\\n(a) Toss a coin.\\n\\nP{heads} =\\n\\n#(A)\\n#(â¦)\\n\\n=\\n\\n.\\n\\nP{toss at least two heads in a row} =\\n\\n#(A)\\n#(â¦)\\n\\n=\\n\\n(b) Toss a coin three times.\\n\\n(c) Roll two dice.\\n\\n#(A)\\n#(â¦)\\nBecause we always have 0 â¤ #(A) â¤ #(â¦), we always have\\nP (A) â¥ 0\\n\\nP{sum is 7} =\\n\\n=\\n\\nand\\n\\nP (â¦) = 1\\n\\nThis gives us 2 of the three axioms. The third will require more development.\\nToss a coin 4 times.\\nA = {exactly 3 heads} = {HHHT, HHTH, HTHH, THHH}\\n4\\n16\\n\\nP (A) =\\n\\n1\\n4\\n\\n=\\n\\nB = {exactly 4 heads} = {HHHH}\\n\\n82\\n\\n(5.1)\\n\\n(5.2)\\n\\n#(â¦) = 16\\n#(A) = 4\\n\\n#(B) = 1\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nThe Basics of Probability\\n\\nNow letâs deï¬ne the set C = {at least three heads}. If you are asked the supply the probability of C, your intuition\\n\\nis likely to give you an immediate answer.\\n\\nP (B) =\\n\\n1\\n16\\n\\nP (C) =\\n\\n5\\n16\\n\\n.\\n\\nLetâs have a look at this intuition. The events A and B have no outcomes in common,. We say that the two events\\n\\nare disjoint or mutually exclusive and write A â© B = â. In this situation,\\n#(A âª B) = #(A) + #(B).\\n\\nIf we take this addition principle and divide by #(â¦), then we obtain the following identity:\\n\\nIf A â© B = â, then\\n\\nor\\n\\nUsing this property, we see that\\n\\n#(A âª B)\\n\\n#(â¦)\\n\\n=\\n\\n#(A)\\n#(â¦)\\n\\n+\\n\\n#(B)\\n#(â¦)\\n\\n.\\n\\nP (A âª B) = P (A) + P (B).\\n\\n(5.3)\\n\\nP{at least 3 heads} = P{exactly 3 heads} + P{exactly 4 heads} =\\n\\n4\\n16\\n\\n+\\n\\n1\\n16\\n\\n=\\n\\n5\\n16\\n\\n.\\n\\nWe are saying that any function P that accepts events as its domain and returns numbers as its range and satisï¬es\\n\\nAxioms 1, 2, and 3 as deï¬ned in (5.1), (5.2), and (5.3) can be called a probability.\\n\\nthen\\n\\nIf we iterate the procedure in Axiom 3, we can also state that if the events, A1, A2,Â·Â·Â· , An, are mutually exclusive,\\n(5.3(cid:48))\\nThis is a sufï¬cient deï¬nition for a probability if the sample space â¦ is ï¬nite. However, we will want to examine\\ninï¬nite sample spaces and to use the idea of limits. This introduction of limits is the pathway that allows to bring in\\ncalculus with all of its powerful theory and techniques as a tool in the development of the theory of probability.\\n\\nP (A1 âª A2 âª Â·Â·Â· âª An) = P (A1) + P (A2) + Â·Â·Â· + P (An).\\n\\nExample 5.2. For the random experiment, consider a rare event - a lightning strike at a given location, winning the\\nlottery, ï¬nding a planet with life - and look for this event repeatedly until it occurs, we can write\\n\\nThen, each of the Aj are mutually exclusive and\\n\\nAj = {the ï¬rst occurrence appears on the j-th observation}.\\n\\n{event occurs eventually} = A1 âª A2 âª Â·Â·Â· âª An âª Â·Â·Â· =\\n\\nâ(cid:91)j=1\\n\\nAj = {Ï; Ï â Aj for some j}.\\n\\nWe would like to say that\\n\\nP{event occurs ventually} = P (A1) + P (A2) + Â·Â·Â· + P (An) + Â·Â·Â· =\\n\\nâ(cid:88)j=1\\n\\nP (Aj) = lim\\nnââ\\n\\nP (Aj).\\n\\nn(cid:88)j=1\\n\\n83\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nThe Basics of Probability\\n\\nFigure 5.1: (left) Difference and Monotonicity Rule.

Using area as an analogy for probability, P (B \\\\ A) is the area between the circles and the area\\nP (A) + P (B) double counts the lens shaped area P (A â© B).\\nThis would call for an extension of Axiom 3 to an inï¬nite number of mutually exclusive events. This is the general\\nversion of Axiom 3 we use when we want to use calculus in the theory of probability:\\n\\nFor mutually exclusive events, {Aj; j â¥ 1}, then\\n\\nP\\uf8eb\\uf8ed\\nâ(cid:91)j=1\\n\\nAj\\uf8f6\\uf8f8 =\\n\\nâ(cid:88)j=1\\n\\nP (Aj)\\n\\n(5.3(cid:48)(cid:48))\\n\\nThus, statements (5.1), (5.2), and (5.3â) give us the complete axioms of probability.\\n\\n5.3 Consequences of the Axioms\\nOther properties that we associate with a probability can be derived from the axioms.\\n\\n1. The Complement Rule. Because A and its complement Ac = {Ï; Ï /â A} are mutually exclusive\\n\\nor\\n\\nP (A) + P (Ac) = P (A âª Ac) = P (â¦) = 1\\n\\nP (Ac) = 1 â P (A).\\n\\nFor example, if we toss a biased coin. We may want to say that P{heads} = p where p is not necessarily equal\\nto 1/2. By necessity,\\n\\nExample 5.3. Toss a coin 4 times.\\n\\nP{tails} = 1 â p.\\n\\nP{fewer than 3 heads} = 1 â P{at least 3 heads} = 1 â\\n\\n5\\n16\\n\\n=\\n\\n11\\n16\\n\\n.\\n\\n2. The Difference Rule. Write B \\\\ A to denote the outcomes that are in B but not in A. If A â B, then\\n\\n(The symbol â denotes âcontains inâ. A and B \\\\ A are mutually exclusive and their union is B.

If A â B, then P (A) â¤ P (B)\\n\\nWe already know that for any event A, P (A) â¥ 0. The monotonicity rule adds to this the fact that\\n\\nThus, the range of a probability is a subset of the interval [0, 1].\\n\\n4. The Inclusion-Exclusion Rule.

See Figure 5.1 (right).\\nExercise 5.5. Show that the inclusion-exclusion rule follows from the axioms. Hint: A âª B = (A â© Bc) âª B\\nand A = (A â© Bc) âª (A â© B).\\nExercise 5.6.

These counting problems can become quite challenging and many advanced mathematical techniques have\\nbeen developed to address these issues. However, having some facility in counting is necessary to have a sufï¬ciently\\nrich number of examples to give meaning to the axioms of probability. Consequently, we shall develop a few counting\\ntechniques leading to the concepts of permutations and combinations.\\n\\n5.4.1 Fundamental Principle of Counting\\nWe start with the fundamental principle of counting.\\nSuppose that two experiments are to be performed.\\nâ¢ Experiment 1 can have n1 possible outcomes and\\nâ¢ for each outcome of experiment 1, experiment 2 has n2 possible outcomes.\\n\\n86\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nThe Basics of Probability\\n\\nThen together there are n1 Ã n2 possible outcomes.\\nExample 5.9. For a group of n individuals, one is chosen to become the president and a second is chosen to become\\nthe treasurer. By the multiplication principle, if these position are held by different individuals, then this task can be\\naccomplished in\\n\\npossible ways\\n\\nn Ã (n â 1)\\n\\nExercise 5.10. Find the number of ways to draw two cards and the number of ways to draw two aces.\\nExercise 5.11. Generalize the fundamental principle of counting to k experiments.\\n\\nAssume that we have a collection of n objects and we wish to make an ordered arrangement of k of these\\nobjects. We call this a permutation of n objects of size k. Using the generalized multiplication principle, the number\\nof possible outcomes is\\n\\nWe will write this as (n)k and say n falling k. Correspondingly, we hve the notion of the rising factorial, also referred\\nto as the Pochhammer symbol.\\n\\nn Ã (n â 1) Ã Â·Â·Â· Ã (n â k + 1).\\n\\nn(k) = n Ã (n + 1) Ã Â·Â·Â· Ã (n + k â 1).\\n\\n5.4.2 Permutations\\nExample 5.12 (birthday problem). In a list the birthday of k people, there are 365k possible lists (ignoring leap year\\nday births) and\\n\\n(365)k\\n\\npossible lists with no date written twice. Thus, the probability, under equally likely outcomes, that no two people on\\nthe list have the same birthday is\\n\\nand, by the complement rule,\\n\\n(365)k\\n365k =\\n\\n365 Â· 364Â·Â·Â· (365 â k + 1)\\n\\n365k\\n\\nP{at least one pair of individuals share a birthday} = 1 â\\n\\n(365)k\\n365k\\n\\n(5.1)\\n\\nHere is a short table of these probabilities. A graph is given in Figure 5.3.\\n\\nk\\n\\n5\\n\\n10\\n\\n15\\n\\n18\\n\\n20\\n\\n22\\n\\n23\\n\\n25\\n\\n30\\n\\n40\\n\\n50\\n\\nprobability\\n\\n0.027\\n\\n0.117\\n\\n0.253\\n\\n0.347\\n\\n0.411\\n\\n0.476\\n\\n0.507\\n\\n0.569\\n\\n0.706\\n\\n0.891\\n\\n0.970\\n\\n100\\n0.994\\n\\nThe R code and output follows.

We can perform clinical trials to estimate the probability that a randomly chosen individual tests positive\\ngiven that they have the disease,\\n\\nP{tests positive|has the disease} = P (A|C),\\n\\nby taking individuals with the disease and applying the test. However, we would like to use the test as a method of\\ndiagnosis of the disease. Thus, we would like to be able to give the test and assert the chance that the person has the\\ndisease. That is, we want to know the probability with the reverse conditioning\\n\\nP{has the disease|tests positive} = P (C|A).\\nExample 6.9. The Public Health Department gives us the following information.\\n\\nâ¢ A test for the disease yields a positive result 90% of the time when the disease is present.\\nâ¢ A test for the disease yields a positive result 1% of the time when the disease is not present.\\nâ¢ One person in 1,000 has the disease.\\nLetâs ï¬rst think about this intuitively and then look to a more formal way using Bayes formula to ï¬nd the probability\\n\\nof\\n\\nP (C|A).\\n\\n100\\n\\nACcC\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nConditional Probability and Independence\\n\\n\\x01\\n\\x01\\n1,000,000 people\\nA\\nA\\n\\n\\x01\\x15\\n\\x01\\n\\nA\\nAU\\n\\nP (C) = 0.001\\n\\n1,000 have the disease\\n\\nP (A|C)P (C) = 0.0009\\n900 test positive\\n\\nP (Ac|C)P (C) = 0.0001\\n100 test negative\\n\\n\\x01\\x15\\n\\x01\\n\\nA\\nAU\\n\\nP (A|Cc )P (Cc ) = 0.00999\\n\\x01\\x15\\n\\x01\\n999,000 do not have the disease\\nA\\nP (Ac|Cc )P (Cc ) = 0.98901\\nAU\\n989,010 test negative\\n\\n9,990 test positive\\n\\nP (Cc ) = 0.999\\n\\nFigure 6.6: Tree diagram. We can use a tree diagram to indicate the number of individuals, on average, in each group (in black) or the probablity\\n(in blue). Notice that in each column the number of individuals adds to give 1,000,000 and the probabilities add to give 1. In addition, each pair of\\narrows divides an events into two mutually exclusive subevents. Thus, both the numbers and the probabilities at the tip of the arrows add to give the\\nrespective values at the head of the arrow.\\n\\nâ¢ In a city with a population of 1 million people, on average,\\n\\n1,000 have the disease and 999,000 do not\\n\\nâ¢ Of the 1,000 that have the disease, on average,\\n\\n900 test positive and 100 test negative\\n\\nâ¢ Of the 999,000 that do not have the disease, on average,\\n\\n999,000 Ã 0.01 = 9990 test positive and 989,010 test negative.\\n\\nWe can record this information in a table. First we place the total number of those with (1,000) and without\\n(999,000) the disease along the bottom row. We then use the information on positive and negative results for the test\\nto ï¬ll in the columns to show 9:1 odds for positive test for those who have the disease and a 1:99 odds for those who\\ndo not.\\n\\ntest positive\\ntest negative\\n\\ntotal\\n\\nhas the disease\\n900\\n100\\n1,000\\n\\ndoes not have the disease\\n9,990\\n989,010\\n990,000\\n\\ntotal\\n10,890\\n989,110\\n1,000,000\\n\\nHaving ï¬lled in the columns, Bayes formula has us look at odds along the rows.

Successful analysis of the results of a clinical test requires researchers to provide\\nresults on the quality of the test and public health workers to provide information on the prevalence of a disease. The conditional probabilities\\nprovided by the researchers tell us about the chances of having the disease given the outcome of the test. The probability of a person having the\\ndisease might be provided by the public health service (shown by the east arrow). Both are necessary for the clinician to be able to use Bayes\\nformula (6.7), to give the conditional probability of having the disease given the test result. Notice, in particular, that the order of the conditioning\\nneeded by the clinician is the reverse of that provided by the researcher. If the clinicians provide reliable data to the public health service, then this\\ninformation can be used to update the probabilities for the prevalence of the disease (indicated by the northwest arrow). The numbers in gray can\\nbe computed from the numbers in black by using the complement rule. In particular, the column sums for the researchers and the row sums for the\\nclinicians much be 1.\\n\\nand converting odds to probability we see that\\n\\nP{have the disease|test is positive} =\\n\\n900\\n\\n900 + 9990\\n\\n=\\n\\n900\\n10890\\n\\n= 0.0826.\\n\\nWe now derive Bayes formula. First notice that we can ï¬ip the order of conditioning by using the multiplication\\n\\nformula (6.2) twice\\n\\nP (A|C)P (C)\\nP (C|A)P (A)\\nNow we can create a formula for P (C|A) as desired in terms of P (A|C).\\nP (C|A)P (A) = P (A|C)P (C) or P (C|A) =\\n\\nP (A â© C) =\\uf8f1\\uf8f2\\uf8f3\\n\\nP (A|C)\\nP (A)\\n\\nP (C)\\n\\n(6.6)\\n\\nGenerally, we call P (C) the prior probability of C. With A given, we call P (C|A) the posterior probability of\\n\\nA. The Bayes factor\\n\\nP (A|C)\\nP (A)\\n\\n.\\n\\nis their ratio as given by the second equality in (6.6).\\n\\nExample 6.10. Both autism A and epilepsy C exists at approximately 1% in human populations. In this case, from\\nthe ï¬rst identity in (6.6),\\n\\nClinical evidence shows that this common value is about 30%. The Bayes factor is\\n\\nP (A|C) â P (C|A)\\n\\nThus, the knowledge of one disease increases the chance of the other by a factor of 30.\\n\\nP (A|C)\\nP (A) â\\n\\n0.3\\n0.01\\n\\n= 30.\\n\\n102\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nConditional Probability and Independence\\n\\nFrom this formula we see that in order to determine P (C|A) from P (A|C), we also need to know P (C), the\\nfraction of the population with the disease and P (A). We can ï¬nd P (A) using the law of total probability in (6.5) and\\nwrite Bayes formula as\\n\\nP (C|A) =\\n\\nP (A|C)P (C)\\n\\nP (A|C)P (C) + P (A|C c)P (C c)\\n\\n.\\n\\n(6.7)\\n\\nThis shows us that we can determine P (A) if, in addition, we collect information from our clinical trials on P (A|C c),\\nthe fraction that test positive who do not have the disease.\\n\\nLetâs now compute P (C|A) for the example above using Bayes formula di-\\nrectly and use this opportunity to introduce some terminology. We have that\\nP (A|C) = 0.90. We use the expression true positive probability or the sensi-\\ntivity for the chance that we have a correct positive diagnosis to those who have\\nthe disease. If one tests negative for the disease (the outcome is in Ac) given that\\none has the disease, (the outcome is in C), then we call this a false negative. In\\nthis case, the false negative probability is P (Ac|C) = 0.10\\nIf one tests positive for the disease (the outcome is in A) given that one does\\nnot have the disease, (the outcome is in C c), then we call this a false positive. In\\nthis case, the false positive probability is P (A|C c) = 0.01. The true negative\\nprobability P (Ac|C c) = 0.99 is also called the speciï¬city.\\nThe probability of having the disease is P (C) = 0.001 and so the probability\\nof being disease free is P (C c) = 0.999. Now, we apply the law of total probability\\n(6.5) as the ï¬rst step in Bayes formula (6.7),\\n\\ntrue\\n\\nfalse\\n\\npositive\\npositive\\nP (A|C c)\\nP (A|C)\\nfalse\\nnegative\\nnegative\\nP (Ac|C) P (Ac|C c)\\n\\ntrue\\n\\nTable II: Terminology for conditional\\nprobabilities. A is the event âtests posi-\\ntiveâ and C is the event âhas the diseaseâ.\\nNotice that the columns sum to one.\\n\\nP (A) = P (A|C)P (C) + P (A|C c)P (C c)\\n\\n= 0.90 Â· 0.001 + 0.01 Â· 0.999 = 0.0009 + 0.009999 = 0.01089.\\n\\nThus, the probability of having the disease given that the test was positive is\\n\\nP (C|A) =\\n\\nP (A|C)P (C)\\n\\nP (A)\\n\\n=\\n\\n0.0009\\n0.01089\\n\\n= 0.0826.\\n\\nNotice that the numerator is one of the terms that was summed to compute the denominator.\\n\\nWe can take the terminology above a give formulas to the elements in the table above.\\n\\ntest positive\\ntest negative\\n\\ntotal\\n\\n900\\n100\\n1,000\\n\\nhas the disease\\n\\n= true positive rate Ã #disease\\n= false negative rate Ã #disease\\n\\n9,990\\n989,010\\n990,000\\n\\ndoes not have the disease\\n= false positive rate Ã #disease free\\n= true negative rate Ã #disease free\\n\\ntotal\\n10,890\\n989,110\\n1,000,000\\n\\nThe answer in the previous example may be surprising. Only 8% of those who test positive actually have the\\ndisease. This example underscores the fact that good predictions based on intuition are hard to make in this case. To\\ndetermine the probability, we must weigh the odds of two terms, each of them itself a product.\\n\\nâ¢ P (A|C)P (C), a big number (the true positive probability) times a small number (the probability of having the\\n\\ndisease) versus\\n\\nâ¢ P (A|C c)P (C c), a small number (the false positive probability) times a large number (the probability of being\\n\\ndisease free).\\n\\nWe do not need to restrict Bayes formula to the case of C, has the disease, and C c, does not have the disease, as\\nseen in (6.5), but rather to any partition of the sample space. Indeed, Bayes formula can be generalized to the case of\\na partition {C1, C2, . . . , Cn} of â¦ chosen so that P (Ci) > 0 for all i. Then, for any event A â â¦ and any j\\n\\nP (Cj|A) =\\n\\n(cid:80)n\\n\\nP (A|Cj)P (Cj)\\ni=1 P (A|Ci)P (Ci)\\n103\\n\\n.\\n\\n(6.8)\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nConditional Probability and Independence\\n\\nTo understand why this is true, use the law of total probability to see that the denominator is equal to P (A). By\\nthe multiplication identity for conditional probability, the numerator is equal to P (Cj â© A). Now, make these two\\nsubstitutions into (6.8) and use one more time the deï¬nition of conditional probability.\\nExample 6.11. We begin with a simple and seemingly silly example involving fair and two sided coins. However, we\\nshall soon see that this leads us to a question in the vertical transmission of a genetic disease.\\n\\nA box has a two-headed coin and a fair coin. It is ï¬ipped n times, yielding heads each time. What is the probability\\n\\nthat the two-headed coin is chosen?\\n\\nTo solve this, note that\\n\\nP{two-headed coin} =\\n\\n1\\n2\\n\\n,\\n\\nP{fair coin} =\\n\\n1\\n2\\n\\n.\\n\\nand\\n\\nBy the law of total probability,\\n\\nP{n heads|two-headed coin} = 1,\\n\\nP{n heads|fair coin} = 2\\n\\nân.\\n\\nP{n heads} = P{n heads|two-headed coin}P{two-headed coin} + P{n heads|fair coin}P{fair coin}\\n\\n1\\n2\\nNext, we use Bayes formula.\\n\\n= 1 Â·\\n\\n+ 2\\n\\nân Â·\\n\\n1\\n2\\n\\n=\\n\\n2n + 1\\n2n+1 .\\n\\nP{two-headed coin|n heads} =\\n\\nP{n heads|two-headed coin}P{two-headed coin}\\n\\nP{n heads}\\n\\n=\\n\\n1 Â· (1/2)\\n\\n(2n + 1)/2n+1 =\\n\\n2n\\n\\n2n + 1\\n\\n< 1.\\n\\nNotice that as n increases, the probability of a two headed coin approaches 1 - with a longer and longer sequence\\nof heads we become increasingly suspicious (but, because the probability remains less than one, are never completely\\ncertain) that we have chosen the two headed coin.\\n\\nThis is the related genetics question: Based on the pedigree of her past, a female knows that she has in her history\\na allele on her X chromosome that indicates a genetic condition. The allele for the condition is recessive. Because\\nshe does not have the condition, she knows that she cannot be homozygous for the recessive allele. Consequently, she\\nwants to know her chance of being a carrier (heteorzygous) or not a carrier (homozygous for the common genetic\\ntype) of the condition. The female is a mother with n male offspring, none of which show the recessive allele on their\\nsingle X chromosome and so do not have the condition. What is the probability that the female is not a carrier?\\n\\nLetâs look at the computation above again, based on her pedigree, the female estimates that\\n\\nP{mother is not a carrier} = p,\\n\\nP{mother is a carrier} = 1 â p.\\n\\nThen, from the law of total probability\\n\\nP{n male offspring condition free}\\n\\n= P{n male offspring condition free|mother is not a carrier}P{mother is not a carrier}\\n\\n+P{n male offspring condition free|mother is a carrier}P{mother is a carrier}\\n\\n= 1 Â· p + 2\\n\\nân Â· (1 â p).\\n\\nand Bayes formula\\n\\n=\\n\\n=\\n\\nP{mother is not a carrier|n male offspring condition free}\\nP{n male offspring condition free|mother is not a carrier}P{mother is not a carrier}\\nP{n male offspring condition free}\\n.\\np + 2ân(1 â p)\\n2np + (1 â p)\\n104\\n\\n1 Â· p + 2ân Â· (1 â p)\\n\\n1 Â· p\\n\\n2np\\n\\n=\\n\\n=\\n\\np\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nConditional Probability and Independence\\n\\nFigure 6.7: Probability of mother being carrier free, given n sons are disease free for n = 1 (black), 2 (orange), 3 (red), 4 ( (magenta), and 5\\n(blue), The vertical dashed line at p = 1/2 is the caae for the the boxes, one with a fair coin and one with a two-headed coin.

That is, we tossed for it and he won. â Joseph Doob,\\nStatistical Science\\n\\n7.1 Introduction\\nFrom the universe of possible information, we ask\\na question. To address this question, we might col-\\nlect quantitative data and organize it, for example,\\nusing the empirical cumulative distribution func-\\ntion. With this information, we are able to com-\\npute sample means, standard deviations, medians\\nand so on.\\n\\nSimilarly, even a fairly simple probability\\nmodel can have an enormous number of outcomes.\\nFor example, ï¬ip a coin 333 times. Then the num-\\nber of outcomes is more than a google (10100) â\\na number at least 100 quintillion times the num-\\nber of elementary particles in the known universe.\\nWe may not be interested in an analysis that con-\\nsiders separately every possible outcome but rather\\nsome simpler concept like the number of heads or\\nthe longest run of tails. To focus our attention on\\nthe issues of interest, we take a given outcome and\\ncompute a number. This function is called a ran-\\ndom variable.\\nDeï¬nition 7.1.

Examining\\nprobabilities models and random variables will lead to strategies for the collection\\nof data and inference from these data.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, we shall use capital letters near the end of the alphabet, e.g., X, Y, Z for random variables.\\n\\nThe range S of a random variable is sometimes called the state space.\\n\\nX : â¦ â R.\\n\\n111\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nRandom Variables and Distribution Functions\\n\\nExercise 7.2.

Flip a coin 10 times and consider the sample space â¦, the set of 10-tuples of heads and tails, and give\\nsome random variables on â¦.\\n\\nWe often create new random variables via composition of functions:\\n\\nThus, if X is a random variable, then so are\\n\\nÏ (cid:55)â X(Ï) (cid:55)â f (X(Ï))\\n\\nX 2,\\n\\nexp Î±X, (cid:112)X 2 + 1,\\n\\ntan2 X,\\n\\n(cid:98)X(cid:99)\\n\\nand so on. The last of these, rounding down X to the nearest integer, is called the ï¬oor function.\\nExercise 7.4. How would we use the ï¬oor function to round down a number x to n decimal places.\\n\\n7.2 Distribution Functions\\nHaving deï¬ned a random variable of interest, X, the question typically becomes, âWhat are the chances that X lands\\nin some subset of values B?â For example,\\n\\nB = {odd numbers}, B = {greater than 1},\\n\\nor B = {between 2 and 7}.\\n\\nWe write\\n\\n(7.1)\\nto indicate those outcomes Ï which have X(Ï), the value of the random variable, in the subset B. We shall often\\nabbreviate (7.1) to the shorter {X â B}. Thus, for the example above, we may write the events\\n\\n{Ï â â¦; X(Ï) â B}\\n\\n{X is an odd number},\\n\\n{X is greater than 1} = {X > 1},\\n\\n{X is between 2 and 7} = {2 < X < 7}\\n\\nto correspond to the three choices above for the subset B.\\n\\nMany of the properties of random variables are not concerned with the speciï¬c random variable X given above,\\nbut rather depends on the way X distributes its values. This leads to a deï¬nition in the context of random variables\\nthat we saw previously with quantitive data.\\nDeï¬nition 7.5. A (cumulative) distribution function of a random variable X is deï¬ned by\\n\\nRecall that with quantitative observations, we called the analogous notion the empirical cumulative distribution\\n\\nfunction. Using the abbreviated notation above, we shall typically write the less explicit expression\\n\\nFX (x) = P{Ï â â¦; X(Ï) â¤ x}.\\n\\nFX (x) = P{X â¤ x}\\n\\nfor the distribution function.\\nExercise 7.6.

For a random variable X and subset B of the sample space S, deï¬ne\\n\\nShow that PX is a probability.\\n\\nPX (B) = P{X â B}.\\n\\nFor {X > x}, the complement of {X â¤ x}, we have the survival function\\n\\nÂ¯FX (x) = P{X > x} = 1 â P{X â¤ x} = 1 â FX (x).\\nChoose a < b, then the event {X â¤ a} â {X â¤ b}. Their set theoretic difference\\n\\n{X â¤ b} \\\\ {X â¤ a} = {a < X â¤ b}.\\n\\nIn words, the event that âX is less than or equal to b but not less than or equal to aâ is the same event as âX is greater\\nthan a and less than or equal to b.â Consequently, by the difference rule for probabilities,\\n\\nP{a < X â¤ b} = P ({X â¤ b} \\\\ {X â¤ a}) = P{X â¤ b} â P{X â¤ a} = FX (b) â FX (a).\\n\\n(7.2)\\n\\nThus, we can compute the probability that a random variable takes values in an interval by subtracting the distri-\\nbution function evaluated at the endpoints of the intervals. Care is needed on the issue of the inclusion or exclusion of\\nthe endpoints of the interval.\\n\\nExample 7.8.

In this example, P{X = 5} = 4/36, the size of the\\njump at x = 5.

A continuous random variable has a cumulative distribution function FX that is differentiable.\\n\\nSo, distribution functions for continuous random variables increase\\nsmoothly. To show how this can occur, we will develop an example of a\\ncontinuous random variable.\\n\\nExample 7.16. Consider a dartboard having unit radius.

Then\\n\\nfX (0) = P{X = 0} = P{H} = p\\nfX (1) = P{X = 1} = P{T H} = (1 â p)p\\nfX (2) = P{X = 2} = P{T T H} = (1 â p)2p\\n\\n...\\n\\n...\\n\\n...\\n\\nfX (x) = P{X = x} = P{T Â·Â·Â· T H} = (1 â p)xp\\n\\nSo, the probability mass function fX (x) = (1 â p)xp. Because the terms in this mass function form a geometric\\nsequence, X is called a geometric random variable. Recall that a geometric sequence c, cr, cr2, . . . , crn has sum\\n\\nsn = c + cr + cr2 + Â·Â·Â· + crn =\\n\\nc(1 â rn+1)\\n\\n1 â r\\n\\nfor r (cid:54)= 1. If |r| < 1, then limnââ rn = 0 and thus sn has a limit as n â â. In this case, the inï¬nite sum is the limit\\n(7.5)\\n\\nc + cr + cr2 + Â·Â·Â· + crn + Â·Â·Â· = lim\\n\\nnââ sn =\\n\\n.\\n\\nc\\n1 â r\\n\\nExercise 7.23. Establish the formula (7.5) above for sn.\\n\\nThe mass function above forms a geometric sequence with the ratio r = 1 â p. Consequently, for positive integers\\n\\na and b,\\n\\nb(cid:88)x=a+1\\n\\nP{a < X â¤ b} =\\n\\n=\\n\\n(1 â p)xp = (1 â p)a+1p + Â·Â·Â· + (1 â p)bp\\n\\n(1 â p)a+1p â (1 â p)b+1p\\n\\n1 â (1 â p)\\n\\n= (1 â p)a+1 â (1 â p)b+1\\n\\nWe can take a = â1 to ï¬nd the distribution function for a geometric random variable.\\n\\nFX (b) = P{X â¤ b} = 1 â (1 â p)b+1.\\n\\n(7.6)\\nTo obtain (7.6) in another way, note that the event {X â¥ b + 1} = {X > b} is the same as having the ï¬rst\\nb + 1 coin tosses turn up tails. This event consists of b + 1 independent events each with probability 1 â p. Thus,\\nP{X â¥ b + 1} = P{X > b} = (1 â p)b+1. By noting that the distribution function, FX (b) = 1 â P{X > b}, we\\nagain obtain (7.6).\\nExercise 7.24. Show that for a geometric random variable X,\\n\\nP{X â¥ a + b|X â¥ b} = P{X â¥ a}.\\n\\n(7.7)\\n\\nThis property is called memorylessness. In words, if the ï¬rst b trials results in failures, then the probability of at least\\na additional failures is the same as the probability of at least a failures from the beginning. The fact that we begin with\\nb failures does not impact the number of trials afterwards until a success.\\n\\nConversely, if the memoryless property holds for an N-valued random variable X, then X is a geometric random\\n\\nvariable.\\n\\n117\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nRandom Variables and Distribution Functions\\n\\nThe mass function and the cumulative distribution function for the geometric random variable with parameter\\n\\np = 1/3 can be found in R by writing\\n\\n> x<-0:10\\n> f<-dgeom(x,1/3)\\n> F<-pgeom(x,1/3)\\n\\nThe initial d indicates density and p indicates the probability from the distribution function.\\n> data.frame(x,f,F)\\n\\nf\\n\\nx\\nF\\n0 0.333333333 0.3333333\\n1\\n1 0.222222222 0.5555556\\n2\\n2 0.148148148 0.7037037\\n3\\n3 0.098765432 0.8024691\\n4\\n4 0.065843621 0.8683128\\n5\\n5 0.043895748 0.9122085\\n6\\n6 0.029263832 0.9414723\\n7\\n7 0.019509221 0.9609816\\n8\\n8 0.013006147 0.9739877\\n9\\n10\\n9 0.008670765 0.9826585\\n11 10 0.005780510 0.9884390\\n\\nNote that the difference in values in the distribution function FX (x) â FX (x â 1), giving the height of the jump\\n\\nin FX at x, is equal to the value of the mass function.

Consequently, we will expand on the concepts above to the case\\nof multiple random variables and their joint distribution. For the case of two random variables, X1 and X2, this means\\nlooking at the probability of events,\\n\\nP{X1 â B1, X2 â B2}.\\n\\nFor discrete random variables, take B1 = {x1} and B2 = {x2}. Then, we have\\n7.7.1 Discrete Random Variables\\nDeï¬nition 7.37.

The conditional mass function of X2 given X1 is denoted fX2|X1 (x2|x1) =\\nP{X2 = x2|X1 = x1}. To compute this function,\\n\\nfX2|X1(x2|x1) = P{X2 = x2|X1 = x1} =\\n\\nP{X1 = x1, X2 = x2}\\n\\nP{X1 = x1}\\n\\n=\\n\\nfX1,X2 (x1, x2)\\n\\nfX1(x1)\\n\\n(7.9)\\n\\nprovided fX1 (x1) > 0.\\nExercise 7.39.

For each value of x1, ï¬nd the conditional mass function. fX2|X1(x2|x1) for the values in the table\\nabove.\\n\\n7.7.2 Continuous Random Variables\\nFor continuous random variables, we consider B1 = (x1, x1 + âx1] and B2 = (x2, x2 + âx2] and ask that for some\\nfunction fX1,X2, the joint probability density function to satisfy\\n\\nP{x1 < X1 â¤ x1 + âx1, x2 < X2 â¤ x2 + âx2} â fX1,X2(x1, x2)âx1âx2.\\n\\nSimilar to mass functions, the density functions for X1 and X2 can be obtained from the joint density function\\nby integrating over the values for the other random variable. Also, we sometimes say marginal probability density\\nfunction to distinguish it from the joint probability density function. Thus, for example, in analogy with (7.8).\\n\\nfX1 (x1) =(cid:90) â\\n\\nââ\\n\\nfX1,X2 (x1, x2)dx2.\\n\\n(7.10)\\n\\nWe can obtain this identity starting with (7.8) and using Riemann sums in a manner similar to the argument that led to\\nthe formula for expectation for a continuous random variable.\\n\\nFor the conditional density, we start with\\n\\nP{x2 < X2 â¤ x2 + âx2|x1 < X1 â¤ x1 + âx1} =\\n\\nâ\\n\\nP{x1 < X1 â¤ x1 + âx1, x2 < X2 â¤ x2 + âx2}\\n\\nP{x1 < X1 â¤ x1 + âx1}\\n\\nfX1,X2(x1, x2)âx1âx2\\n\\nfX1,X2(x1, x2)\\n\\n=\\n\\nâx2\\n\\nfX1(x1)âx1\\n\\nfX1 (x1)\\n\\n122\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nRandom Variables and Distribution Functions\\n\\nNext, divide by âx2 and let âx2 â 0.

Find the marginal densities.\\n\\nIndependent Random Variables\\n\\n7.7.3\\nMany of our experimental protocols will be designed so that observations are independent. More precisely, we will\\nsay that two random variables X1 and X2 are independent if any two events associated to them are independent, i.e.,\\n\\nP{X1 â B1, X2 â B2} = P{X1 â B1}P{X2 â B2}.\\n\\nIn words, the probability that the two events {X1 â B1} and {X2 â B2} happen simultaneously is equal to the\\nproduct of the probabilities that each of them happen individually.\\n\\nFor independent discrete random variables, we have that\\n\\nfX1,X2 (x1, x2) = P{X1 = x1, X2 = x2} = P{X1 = x1}P{X2 = x2} = fX1(x1)fX2 (x2).\\nIn this case, we say that the joint probability mass function is the product of the marginal mass functions.\\n\\nFor continuous random variables,\\n\\nfX1,X2(x1, x2)âx1âx2 â P{x1 < X1 â¤ x1 + âx1, x2 < X2 â¤ x2 + âx2}\\n\\n= P{x1 < X1 â¤ x1 + âx1}P{x2 < X2 â¤ x2 + âx2} â fX1(x1)âx1fX2(x2)âx2\\n= fX1 (x1)fX2(x2)âx1âx2.\\n\\nThus, for independent continuous random variables, the joint probability density function\\n\\nfX1,X2(x1, x2) = fX1(x1)fX2 (x2)\\n\\nis the product of the marginal density functions.\\nExercise 7.44. Generalize the notion of independent mass and density functions to more than two random variables.\\nSoon, we will be looking at n independent observations x1, x2, . . . , xn arising from an unknown density or mass\\n\\nfunction f. Thus, the joint density is\\n\\nf (x1)f (x2)Â·Â·Â· f (xn).\\n\\nGenerally speaking, the density function f will depend on the choice of a parameter value Î¸. (For example, the\\nunknown parameter in the density function for an exponential random variable that describes the waiting time for a\\nbus.) Given the data from the n observations, the likelihood function arises by considering this joint density not as\\na function of x1, . . . , xn, but rather as a function of the parameter Î¸. We shall learn how the study of the likelihood\\nplays a major role in parameter estimation and in the testing of hypotheses.\\n\\n123\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nRandom Variables and Distribution Functions\\n\\n7.8 Simulating Random Variables\\nOne goal for these notes is to provide the tools needed to design inferential procedures based on sound principles of\\nstatistical science. Thus, one of the very important uses of statistical software is the ability to generate pseudo-data\\nto simulate the actual data. This provides the opportunity to explore the properties of the data through simulation\\nand to test and reï¬ne methods of analysis in advance of the need to use these methods on genuine data. For many of\\nthe frequently used families of random variables, R provides commands for their simulation. We shall examine these\\nfamilies and their properties in Topic 9, Examples of Mass Functions and Densities. For other circumstances, we will\\nneed to have methods for simulating sequence of independent random variables that possess a common distribution.\\nWe ï¬rst consider the case of discrete random variables.\\n\\n7.8.1 Discrete Random Variables and the sample Command\\nThe sample command is used to create simple and stratiï¬ed random samples. Thus, if we enter a sequence x,\\nsample(x,40) chooses 40 entries from x in such a way that all choices of size 40 have the same probability.\\n\\nThis uses the default R command of sampling without replacement. We can use this command to simulate\\ndiscrete random variables. To do this, we need to give the state space in a vector x and a mass function f. The call for\\nreplace=TRUE indicates that we are sampling with replacement. Then to give a sample of n independent random\\nvariables having common mass function f, we use sample(x,n,replace=TRUE,prob=f).\\n\\nExample 7.45. Let X be described by the mass function\\n\\nx\\n\\nfX (x)\\n\\n1\\n0.1\\n\\n2\\n0.2\\n\\n3\\n0.3\\n\\n4\\n0.4\\n\\nThen to simulate 50 independent observations from this mass function:\\n\\n> x<-c(1,2,3,4); f<-c(0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4)\\n> sum(f)\\n[1] 1\\n> data<-sample(x,50,replace=TRUE,prob=f)\\n> data\\n\\n[1] 1 4 4 4 4 4 3 3 4 3 3 2 3 3 3 4 4 3 3 2 4 1 3 3 4 2 3 3 3 1 2 4 3 2 3 4 4 4 4 2 4 1\\n\\n[43] 2 3 4 4 1 4 3 4\\n\\nNotice that 1 is the least represented value and 4 is the most represented. If the command prob=f is omitted, then\\nsample will choose uniformly from the values in the vector x. Letâs check our simulation against the mass function\\nthat generated the data. First, recount the observations that take on each possible value for x. We can make a table.\\n\\n> table(data)\\ndata\\n\\n1\\n5\\n\\n2\\n3 4\\n7 18 20\\n\\nor use the counts to determine the simulated proportions.\\n\\n> counts<-numeric(4)\\n> for (i in 1:4){counts[i]<-sum(data==i)}\\n> simprob<-counts/(sum(counts))\\n> data.frame(x,f,simprob)\\n\\nx\\n\\nf simprob\\n\\n1 1 0.1 0.10\\n2 2 0.2 0.14\\n3 3 0.3 0.36\\n4 4 0.4 0.40\\n\\n124\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nRandom Variables and Distribution Functions\\n\\nThe expression data==i returns a sequence FALSE and TRUE. the sum command adds up the number of times\\nTRUE appears.\\n\\nExercise 7.46. Simulate the sums on each of 20 rolls of a pair of dice. Repeat this for 1000 rolls and compare the\\nsimulation with the appropriate mass function.\\n\\nExercise 7.47. Simulate the mixture in Exercise 7.36 and comment on how it matches the mixture mass function.\\n\\n7.8.2 Continuous Random Variables and the Probability Transform\\nIf X a continuous random variable with a density fX that is positive everywhere in its domain, then the distribution\\nâ1\\nfunction FX (x) = P{X â¤ x} is strictly increasing. In this case FX has a inverse function F\\nX , known as the\\nquantile function.\\nExercise 7.48.

Given a random variable, the correspond-\\ning concept is given a variety of names, including the distributional mean, the expectation or the expected value.\\nWe begin with the case of discrete random variables where this analogy is more apparent. The formula for contin-\\nuous random variables is obtained by approximating with a discrete random variable and noticing that the formula\\nfor the expected value is a Riemann sum. Thus, expected values for continuous random variables are determined by\\ncomputing an integral.\\n\\n8.1 Deï¬nition and Properties\\n\\nRecall for a data set taking numerical values x1, x2, . . . , xn, one of the methods for computing the sample mean of a\\nreal-valued function h of the data is accomplished by evaluating the sum,\\n\\nh(x) =(cid:88)x\\n\\nh(x)p(x),\\n\\nwhere p(x) is the proportion of observations taking the value x.\\n\\nFor a ï¬nite sample space â¦ = {Ï1, Ï2, . . . , ÏN} and a probability P on â¦, we can deï¬ne the expectation or the\\n\\nexpected value of a random variable X by an analogous average,\\n\\nMore generally for a real-valued function g of the random vector X = (X1, X2, . . . , Xn), we have the formula\\n\\nEX =\\n\\nN(cid:88)j=1\\n\\nX(Ïj)P{Ïj}.\\n\\nEg(X) =\\n\\nN(cid:88)j=1\\n\\ng(X(Ïj))P{Ïj}.\\n\\n(8.1)\\n\\n(8.2)\\n\\nNotice that even though we have this analogy, the two formulas come from very different starting points. The value\\nof h(x) is derived from data whereas no data are involved in computing Eg(X). The starting point for the expected\\nvalue is a probability model.\\n\\n137\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nThe Expected Value\\n\\nExample 8.1. Roll one die. Then â¦ = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Let X be the value on the die. So, X(Ï) = Ï. If the die is\\nfair, then the probability model has P{Ï} = 1/6 for each outcome Ï. Using the formula (8.1), the expected value\\n\\nEX = 1 Â· P{1} + 2 Â· P{2} + 3 Â· P{3} + 4 Â· P{4} + 5 Â· P{5} + 6 Â· P{6}\\n\\n= 1 Â·\\n\\n+ 2 Â·\\n\\n+ 3 Â·\\n\\n+ 4 Â·\\n\\n+ 5 Â·\\n\\n+ 6 Â·\\n\\n1\\n6\\n\\n1\\n6\\n\\n1\\n6\\n\\n1\\n6\\n\\n1\\n6\\n\\n1\\n6\\n\\n=\\n\\n=\\n\\n21\\n6\\n\\n7\\n2\\n\\n.\\n\\nAn example of an unfair dice would be the probability with P{1} = P{2} = P{3} = 1/4 and P{4} = P{5} =\\n\\nP{6} = 1/12. In this case, the expected value\\n1\\n4\\n\\nEX = 1 Â·\\n\\n+ 2 Â·\\n\\n1\\n4\\n\\n+ 3 Â·\\n\\n1\\n4\\n\\n+ 4 Â·\\n\\n1\\n12\\n\\n+ 5 Â·\\n\\n1\\n12\\n\\n+ 6 Â·\\n\\n1\\n12\\n\\n=\\n\\n11\\n4\\n\\n.\\n\\nExercise 8.2. Use the formula (8.2) with g(x) = x2 to ï¬nd EX 2 for these two examples.\\n\\nTwo properties of expectation are immediate from the formula for EX in (8.1):\\n\\n1. If X(Ï) â¥ 0 for every outcome Ï â â¦, then every term in the sum in (8.1) is nonnegative and consequently\\n\\ntheir sum EX â¥ 0.\\n\\n2. Let X1 and X2 be two random variables and c1, c2 be two real numbers, then by using g(x1, x2) = c1x1 + c2x2\\n\\nand the distributive property to the sum in (8.2), we ï¬nd out that\\n\\nE[c1X1 + c2X2] = c1EX1 + c2EX2.\\n\\nThe ï¬rst of these properties states that nonnegative random variables have nonnegative expected value. The second\\nstates that expectation is a linear operation. Taking these two properties together, we say that the operation of taking\\nan expectation\\n\\nX (cid:55)â EX\\n\\nis a positive linear functional. We have studied extensively another example of a positive linear functional, namely,\\nthe deï¬nite integral\\n\\ng (cid:55)â(cid:90) b\\n\\na\\n\\ng(x) dx\\n\\nthat takes a continuous positive function and gives the area between the graph of g and the x-axis between the vertical\\nlines x = a and x = b. For this example, these two properties become:\\n\\n1. If g(x) â¥ 0 for every x â [a, b], then(cid:82) b\\n\\na g(x) dx â¥ 0.\\n\\n2. Let g1 and g2 be two continuous functions and c1, c2 be two real numbers, then\\n\\n(cid:90) b\\n\\na\\n\\n(c1g1(x) + c2g2(x)) dx = c1(cid:90) b\\n\\na\\n\\ng1(x) dx + c2(cid:90) b\\n\\na\\n\\ng2(x) dx.\\n\\nThis analogy will be useful to keep in mind when considering the properties of expectation.\\n\\nExample 8.3.

We illustrate this with the example of tossing a coin three times. Let X\\ndenote the number of heads. To compute the expected value EX, we can proceed as described in (8.1). For the table\\nabove, we have grouped the outcomes Ï that have a common value x = 3, 2, 1 or 0 for X(Ï).\\n\\nFrom the deï¬nition of expectation in (8.1), EX, the expected value of X, is the sum of the values in column F. We\\n\\nwant to now show that EX is also the sum of the values in column G.\\n\\nNote, for example, that, three outcomes HHT, HT H and T HH each have two heads and thus give a value of 2\\n\\nfor X. Because these outcomes are disjoint, we can add probabilities\\n\\nP{HHT} + P{HT H} + P{T HH} = P{HHT, HT H, T HH}\\n\\n(8.3)\\n\\nBut, the event\\n\\n{HHT, HT H, T HH} can also be written as the event {X = 2}.\\n\\n(8.4)\\nThis is shown for each value of x in column C, P{X = x}, the probabilities in column E are obtained as a sum of\\nprobabilities in column D.\\nThus, by combining outcomes that result in the same value for the random variable, the sums in the boxes in\\ncolumn F are equal to the value in the corresponding box in column G. and thus their total sums are the same. In other\\nwords,\\n\\nEX = 0 Â· P{X = 0} + 1 Â· P{X = 1} + 2 Â· P{X = 2} + 3 Â· P{X = 3}.\\n\\nAs in the discussion above, we can, in general, ï¬nd for any function g the expectation Eg(X). First, to build a\\ntable, denote the outcomes in the probability space â¦ as Ï1, . . . , Ïk, Ïk+1, . . . , ÏN and the state space for the random\\nvariable X as x1, . . . , xi, . . . , xn.\\n\\nNote that we have partitioned the sample space â¦ into the outcomes Ï that result in the same value x for the random\\nvariable X(Ï). This is shown by the horizontal lines in the table above showing that X(Ïk) = X(Ïk+1) = Â·Â·Â· = xi.\\nThe equality of sum of the probabilities in a box in columns D and the probability in column E can be written, in\\nanalogy with (8.3) and (8.4),\\n\\n(cid:88){Ï;X(Ï)=xi}\\n\\nP{Ï} = P{X = xi}.\\n\\nFor these particular outcomes, g(X(Ï)) = g(xi) and the sum of the values in a boxes in column F,\\n\\n(cid:88)Ï;X(Ï)=xi\\n\\ng(X(Ï))P{Ï} = (cid:88)Ï;X(Ï)=xi\\n\\ng(xi)P{Ï} = g(xi) (cid:88)Ï;X(Ï)=xi\\n\\nP{Ï} = g(xi)P{X = xi},\\n\\n(8.5)\\n\\n139\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nThe Expected Value\\n\\nA\\nÏ\\n\\nB\\n\\nX(Ï)\\n\\n...\\n\\n...\\nÏk\\nX(Ïk)\\nÏk+1 X(Ïk+1)\\n...\\n...\\n\\n...\\n...\\n\\nC\\nx\\n\\n...\\n\\nD\\nP{Ï}\\n\\n...\\n\\nE\\n\\nP{X = x}\\n\\n...\\n\\nF\\n\\ng(X(Ï))P{Ï}\\n\\n...\\n\\nP{Ïk}\\n\\nxi P{Ïk+1} P{X = xi}\\n\\n...\\n...\\n\\n...\\n\\n...\\n\\ng(X(Ïk))P{Ïk}\\n\\ng(X(Ïk+1))P{Ïk+1}\\n\\n...\\n...\\n\\nG\\n\\ng(x)P{X = x}\\n\\n...\\n\\ng(xi)P{X = xi}\\n\\n...\\n\\nTable II: Establishing the identity (8.6) from (8.2). Arrange the rows of the table so that common values of X(Ïk), X(Ïk+1), . . . in the box in\\ncolumn B have the value xi in column C. Thus, the probabilities in a box in column D sum to give the probability in the corresponding box in\\ncolumn E. Because the values for g(X(Ïk)), g(X(Ïk+1)), . . . equal g(xi), the sum in a box in column F sums to the value in the corresponding\\nbox in column G. Thus, the sums in columns F and G are equal. The sum in column F is the deï¬nition in (8.2). The sum in column G is the identity\\n(8.6).\\n\\nthe value in the corresponding box in column G.

Each trial has\\ntwo possible outcomes, variously called,\\nheads-tails, yes-no, up-down, left-right, win-lose, female-male, green-blue, dominant-recessive, or success-failure\\ndepending on the circumstances. We will use the principles of counting and the properties of expectation to analyze\\nBernoulli trials. From the point of view of statistics, the data have an unknown success parameter p. Thus, the goal of\\nstatistical inference is to make as precise a statement as possible for the value of p behind the production of the data.\\nConsequently, any experimenter that uses Bernoulli trials as a model ought to mirror its properties closely.\\nExample 8.6 (Bernoulli trials). Random variables X1, X2, . . . , Xn are called a sequence of Bernoulli trials provided\\nthat:\\n\\n1. Each Xi takes on two values, namely, 0 and 1. We call the value 1 a success and the value 0 a failure.\\n2. Each trial has the same probability for success, i.e., P{Xi = 1} = p for each i.\\n3. The outcomes on each of the trials is independent.\\n\\nFor each trial i, the expected value\\n\\nEXi = 0 Â· P{Xi = 0} + 1 Â· P{Xi = 1} = 0 Â· (1 â p) + 1 Â· p = p\\n\\nis the same as the success probability. Let Sn = X1 + X2 + Â·Â·Â· + Xn be the total number of successes in n Bernoulli\\ntrials. Using the linearity of expectation, we see that\\n\\nthe expected number of successes in n Bernoulli trials is np.\\n\\nESn = E[X1 + X2 Â·Â·Â· + Xn] = p + p + Â·Â·Â· + p = np,\\n\\nIn addition, we can use our ability to count to determine the probability mass function for Sn. Beginning with a\\n\\nconcrete example, let n = 8, and the outcome\\n\\nUsing the independence of the trials, we can compute the probability of this outcome:\\n\\nsuccess, fail, fail, success, fail, fail, success, fail.\\n\\np Ã (1 â p) Ã (1 â p) Ã p Ã (1 â p) Ã (1 â p) Ã p Ã (1 â p) = p3(1 â p)5.\\n\\n3(cid:1) particular sequences of 8 Bernoulli trials having 3 successes also has probability\\nMoreover, any of the possible(cid:0)8\\np3(1 â p)5. Each of the outcomes are mutually exclusive, and, taken together, their union is the event {S8 = 3}.\\nConsequently, by the axioms of probability, we ï¬nd that\\n\\nP{S8 = 3} =(cid:18)8\\n\\n3(cid:19)p3(1 â p)5.\\n\\nReturning to the general case, we replace 8 by n and 3 by x to see that any particular sequence of n Bernoulli\\n\\ntrials having x successes has probability\\n\\nIn addition, we know that we have\\n\\nmutually exclusive sequences of n Bernoulli trials that have x successes. Thus, we have the mass function\\n\\nfSn (x) = P{Sn = x} =(cid:18)n\\n\\nx = 0, 1, . . . , n.\\n\\npx(1 â p)nâx.\\n\\n(cid:18)n\\nx(cid:19)\\nx(cid:19)px(1 â p)nâx,\\n\\n141\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nThe Expected Value\\n\\nThe fact that the sum\\n\\nfSn (x) =\\n\\nn(cid:88)x=0\\n\\nn(cid:88)x=0(cid:18)n\\n\\nx(cid:19)px(1 â p)nâx = (p + (1 â p))n = 1n = 1\\n\\nfollows from the binomial theorem. Consequently, Sn is called a binomial random variable.\\n\\nIn the exercise above where X is the number of hearts in 5 cards, let Xi = 1 if the i-th card is a heart and 0 if it\\nis not a heart. Then, the Xi are not Bernoulli trials because the chance of obtaining a heart on one card depends on\\nwhether or not a heart was obtained on other cards. Still,\\n\\nis the number of hearts and\\n\\nX = X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 + X5\\n\\nEX = EX1 + EX2 + EX3 + EX4 + EX5 = 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 5/4.\\n\\n8.4 Continuous Random Variables\\nFor X a continuous random variable with density\\nfX, consider the discrete random variable ËX ob-\\ntained from X by rounding down. Say, for exam-\\nple, we give lengths by rounding down to the near-\\nest millimeter. Thus, ËX = 2.134 meters for any\\nlengths X satisfying 2.134 meters < X â¤ 2.135\\nmeters.\\nThe random variable ËX is discrete. To be pre-\\ncise about the rounding down procedure, let âx be\\nthe spacing between values for ËX. Then, Ëx, an inte-\\nger multiple of âx, represents a possible value for\\nËX, then this rounding becomes\\n\\nËX = Ëx if and only if\\n\\nËx < X â¤ Ëx + âx.\\n\\nWith this, we can give the mass function\\n\\nFigure 8.1: The discrete random variable ËX is obtained by rounding down the\\ncontinuous random variable X to the nearest multiple of âx. The mass function\\nf ËX (Ëx) is the integral of the density function from Ëx to Ëx + âx indicated at the\\narea under the density function between two consecutive vertical lines.\\n\\nNow, by the property of the density function,\\n\\nf ËX (Ëx) = P{ ËX = Ëx} = P{Ëx < X â¤ Ëx + âx}.\\n\\nP{Ëx â¤ X < Ëx + âx} â fX (x)âx.\\n\\n(8.8)\\n\\nIn this case, we need to be aware of a possible source of confusion due to the similarity in the notation that we have for\\nboth the mass function f ËX for the discrete random variable ËX and a density function fX for the continuous random\\nvariable X.\\n\\nFor this discrete random variable ËX, we can use identity (8.6) and the approximation in (8.8) to approximate the\\n\\nexpected value.\\n\\nEg( ËX) =(cid:88)Ëx\\nâ(cid:88)Ëx\\n\\ng(Ëx)f ËX (Ëx) =(cid:88)Ëx\\n\\ng(Ëx)fx(Ëx)âx.\\n\\n142\\n\\ng(Ëx)P{Ëx â¤ X < Ëx + âx}\\n\\n!0.5!0.2500.250.50.7511.251.51.75200.511.522.53density fXround down! x\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nThe Expected Value\\n\\nThis last sum is a Riemann sum and so taking limits as âx â 0, we have that the distribution of ËX converges to\\n\\nthat for X and the Riemann sum converges to the deï¬nite integral.

The expectation in this case is an n-dimensional Riemann integral. For example, if X1 and X2 has\\njoint density fX1,X2(x1, x2), then\\n\\nEg(X1, X2) =(cid:90) â\\n\\nââ(cid:90) â\\n\\nââ\\n\\ng(x1, x2)fX1,X2(x1, x2) dx2dx1,\\n\\nagain, provided that the improper Riemann integral converges.\\nExample 8.7.

We shall later have need for several of these expectations. Others are included\\nto create a comprehensive reference list.\\n\\n1. If g(x) = x, then Âµ = EX is called variously the (distributional) mean, and the ï¬rst moment.\\n2. If g(x) = xk, then EX k is called the k-th moment. These names were made in analogy to a similar concept in\\n\\nphysics. The second moment in physics is associated to the moment of inertia.\\n\\n3. For integer valued random variables, if g(x) = (x)k, where (x)k = x(x â 1)Â·Â·Â· (x â k + 1), then E(X)k is\\ncalled the k-th factorial moment. For random variable taking values in the natural numbers x = 0, 1, 2, . . .,\\nfactorial moments are typically easier to compute than moments for these random variables.\\n\\n4. If g(x) = (x â Âµ)k, then E(X â Âµ)k is called the k-th central moment.\\n5. The most frequently used central moment is the second central moment Ï2 = E(X â Âµ)2 commonly called the\\n\\n(distributional) variance. Using the linearity properties of expectation, we see that\\n\\nÏ2 = Var(X) = E(X â Âµ)2 = EX 2 â 2ÂµEX + Âµ2 = EX 2 â 2Âµ2 + Âµ2 = EX 2 â Âµ2.\\n\\nThis gives a frequently used alternative to computing the variance. In analogy with the corresponding concept\\nwith quantitative data, we call Ï the standard deviation for the square root of the variance.\\nExercise 8.15. Find the variance of a single Bernoulli trial.\\nExercise 8.16. Compute the variance for the two types of dice in Exercise 8.2.\\nExercise 8.17.

The third moment of the standardized random variable\\n\\nÎ³1 = E(cid:34)(cid:18) X â Âµ\\nÏ (cid:19)3(cid:35)\\n\\nis called the skewness. Random variables with positive skewness have a more pronounced tail to the density\\non the right. Random variables with negative skewness have a more pronounced tail to the density on the left.\\nExercise 8.18. Show that the skewness of X a Bernoulli random variable Ber(p) is\\n\\nThus, X is positively skewed if p < 1/2 and is negatively skewed if p > 1/2.\\n\\n1 â 2p\\n\\n(cid:112)p(1 â p)\\n\\n7. The fourth moment of the standard normal random variable is 3.

Lepto means slender. Random variables with\\na positive kurtosis are called platykurtic. Platy means broad.\\n\\n8. For d-dimensional vectors x = (x1, x2, . . . , xd) and y = (y1, y2, . . . , yd) deï¬ne the standard inner product,\\n\\nIf X is Rd-valued and g(x) = ei(cid:104)Î¸,x(cid:105), then ÏX (Î¸) = Eei(cid:104)Î¸,X(cid:105) is called the Fourier transform or the charac-\\nteristic function. The characteristic function receives its name from the fact that the mapping\\n\\n(cid:104)x, y(cid:105) =\\n\\nxiyi.\\n\\nd(cid:88)i=1\\n\\nfrom the distribution function to the characteristic function is one-to-one. Consequently, if we have a function\\nthat we know to be a characteristic function, then it can only have arisen from one distribution. In this way, ÏX\\ncharacterizes that distribution.\\n\\nFX (cid:55)â ÏX\\n\\n9. Similarly, if X is Rd-valued and g(x) = e(cid:104)Î¸,x(cid:105), then MX (Î¸) = Ee(cid:104)Î¸,X(cid:105) is called the Laplace transform or the\\nmoment generating function. The moment generating function also gives a one-to-one mapping. However,\\nnot every distribution has a moment generating function. To justify the name, consider the one-dimensional case\\nMX (Î¸) = EeÎ¸X. Then, by noting that\\n\\ndk\\ndÎ¸k eÎ¸x = xkeÎ¸x,\\n\\nwe substitute the random variable X for x, take expectation and evaluate at Î¸ = 0.\\n\\nM(cid:48)\\nX (Î¸) = EXeÎ¸X\\nM(cid:48)(cid:48)\\nX (Î¸) = EX 2eÎ¸X\\n\\n...\\n\\nM(cid:48)\\nX (0) = EX\\nM(cid:48)(cid:48)\\nX (0) = EX 2\\n\\n...\\n\\nM (k)\\n\\nX (Î¸) = EX keÎ¸X\\n\\nM (k)\\n\\nX (0) = EX k.\\n\\n10.

Quadratic identity for variance Var(a + bX) = b2Var(X).\\n\\nThe variance is meant to give a sense of the spread of the values of a random variable. Thus, the addition of a\\n\\nconstant a should not change the variance. If we write this in terms of standard deviation, we have that\\n\\nThus, multiplication by a factor b spreads the data, as measured by the standard deviation, by a factor of |b|.\\nparticular,\\n\\nIn\\n\\nThese identities are identical to those for a sample variance s2 and sample standard deviation s.\\n\\nÏa+bX = |b|ÏX .\\n\\nVar(X) = Var(âX).\\n\\n8.7 Independence\\nExpected values in the case of more than one random variable is based on the same concepts as for a single random\\nvariable. For example, for two discrete random variables X1 and X2, the expected value is based on the joint mass\\nfunction fX1,X2 (x1, x2). In this case the expected value is computed using a double sum seen in the identity (8.7).\\n\\nWe will not investigate this in general, but rather focus on the case in which the random variables are independent.\\nHere, we have the factorization identity fX1,X2 (x1, x2) = fX1(x1)fX2 (x2) for the joint mass function. Now, apply\\nidentity (8.7) to the product of functions g(x1, x2) = g1(x1)g2(x2) to ï¬nd that\\n\\nE[g1(X1)g2(X2)] =(cid:88)x1 (cid:88)x2\\n=(cid:32)(cid:88)x1\\n\\ng1(x1)g2(x2)fX1,X2 (x1, x2) =(cid:88)x1 (cid:88)x2\\ng1(x1)fX1 (x1)(cid:33)(cid:32)(cid:88)x2\\n\\ng2(x2)fX2(x2)(cid:33) = E[g1(X1)] Â· E[g2(X2)]\\n\\ng1(x1)g2(x2)fX1(x1)fX2(x2)\\n\\nA similar identity holds for continuous random variables - the expectation\\nof the product of two independent random variables equals to the product of\\nthe expectation.\\n\\n8.8 Covariance and Correlation\\nA very important example begins by taking X1 and X2 random variables with\\nrespective means Âµ1 and Âµ2. Then by the deï¬nition of variance\\n\\nVar(X1 + X2) = E[((X1 + X2) â (Âµ1 + Âµ2))2]\\n= E[((X1 â Âµ1) + (X2 â Âµ2))2]\\n= E[(X1 â Âµ1)2] + 2E[(X1 â Âµ1)(X2 â Âµ2)]\\n\\n+E[(X2 â Âµ2)2]\\n\\n= Var(X1) + 2Cov(X1, X2) + Var(X2).\\nwhere the covariance Cov(X1, X2) = E[(X1 â Âµ1)(X2 â Âµ2)].\\n\\n148\\n\\nindependent\\n\\nthe standard deviations ÏX1\\n\\nFigure 8.4: For\\nrandom vari-\\nables,\\nand\\nÏX2 satisfy the Pythagorean theorem identity\\nÏ2\\nX1+X2\\n\\n= Ï2\\n\\n+ Ï2\\n\\nX1\\n\\nX2\\n\\n.\\n\\n!0.200.20.40.60.811.2!0.200.20.40.60.811.2!X1+X2!X1!X2\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nThe Expected Value\\n\\nExercise 8.22.

The analogy continues\\n\\nto hold for the correlation Ï, deï¬ned by\\n\\nÏ(X1, X2) =\\n\\nCov(X1, X2)\\n\\n(cid:112)Var(X1)(cid:112)Var(X2)\\n\\n.\\n\\nWe can also use the computation for sample covariance to see that distributional covariance is also between â1 and 1.\\nCorrelation 1 occurs only when X and Y have a perfect positive linear association. Correlation â1 occurs only when\\nX and Y have a perfect negative linear association.\\n\\nIf X1 and X2 are independent, then Cov(X1, X2) = E[X1 â Âµ1] Â· E[X2 â Âµ2] = 0 and the variance of the sum is\\n\\nthe sum of the variances. This identity and its analogy to the Pythagorean theorem is shown in Figure 8.4.\\n\\nThe following exercise is the basis in Topic 3 for the simulation of scatterplots having correlation Ï.\\n\\nExercise 8.23. Let X and Z be independent random variables mean 0, variance 1. Deï¬ne Y = Ï0X +(cid:112)1 â Ï2\\n\\nThen Y has mean 0, variance 1. Moreover, X and Y have correlation Ï0.\\n\\n0Z.\\n\\nWe can extend this to a generalized Pythagorean identity for n independent random variable X1, X2, . . . , Xn each\\n\\nhaving a ï¬nite variance.

For example, if we take c1 = c2 Â·Â·Â· = cn = 1, then we\\n\\nhave that for independent random variables\\n\\nVar(X1 + X2 + Â·Â·Â· Xn) = Var(X1) + Var(X2) + Â·Â·Â· + Var(Xn),\\n\\nthe variance of the sum is the sum of the variances.\\n\\nExercise 8.24.

If the random variables are independent, then Cov(Xi, Xj) = 0 and the\\n\\nidentity above give the generalized Pythagorean identity.\\n\\nWe can write this identity more compactly in matrix form. Let c be the vector c1, c2, . . . , cn, X = (X1, X2, . . . Xn,\\n\\nand deï¬ne the covariance matrix Cov(X) with i, j entry Cov(Xi, Xj). Then\\n\\nVar(cT X) = cT Cov(X)c.\\n\\n8.8.1 Equivalent Conditions for Independence\\nWe can summarize the discussions of independence to present the following 4 equivalent conditions for independent\\nrandom variables X1, X2, . . . , Xn.\\n\\n1.

A\\nmore common comparison is between quantitative data and the quantiles of the probability distribution of a continuous\\nrandom variable. We will demonstrate the properties of these plots with an example.\\nExample 8.26. As anticipated by Galileo, errors in independent accurate measurements of a quantity follow approx-\\nimately a sample from a normal distribution with mean equal to the true value of the quantity. The standard deviation\\ngives information on the precision of the measuring devise. We will learn more about this aspect of measurements\\nwhen we study the central limit theorem. Our example is Morleyâs measurements of the speed of light, found in the\\nthird column of the data set morley. The values are the measurements of the speed of light minus 299,000 kilometers\\nper second.\\n\\n> length(morley[,3])\\n[1] 100\\n> mean(morley[,3])\\n[1] 852.4\\n> sd(morley[,3])\\n[1] 79.01055\\n> par(mfrow=c(1,2))\\n> hist(morley[,3])\\n> qqnorm(morley[,3])\\n\\nThe histogram has the characteristic bell shape of the normal density. We can obtain a clearer picture of the\\ncloseness of the data to a normal distribution by drawing a Q-Q plot. (In the case of the normal distribution, the Q-Q\\nplot is often called the normal probability plot.) One method of making this plot begins by ordering the measurements\\nfrom smallest to largest:\\n\\nx(1), x(2), . . . , x(n)\\n\\nNow. give the standardized versions of these values. Let Â¯x be the sample mean and sx be the sample standard deviation\\nfor these data. Then the standardized versions of the ordered measurements are\\n\\nIf these are independent measurements from a standard normal distribution, then these values should be close to\\n\\nthe quantiles of the evenly space values\\n\\nz(i) =\\n\\nx(i) â Â¯x\\n\\nsx\\n\\n.\\n\\n(8.11)\\n\\n1\\n\\nn + 1\\n\\n,\\n\\n2\\n\\nn + 1\\n\\n,Â·Â·Â· ,\\n\\nn\\n\\nn + 1\\n\\n150\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nThe Expected Value\\n\\nFigure 8.5: Histogram and normal probability plot of Morleyâs measurements of the speed of light.\\n\\n(For the Morley data, n = 100). Thus, the next step is to ï¬nd the values in the standard normal distribution that have\\nthese quantiles. We can ï¬nd these values by applying Î¦â1, the inverse distribution function for the standard normal\\n(qnorm in R), applied to the n values listed in (8.11).\\n\\nor\\n\\nx(i) â Â¯x\\n\\nsx\\n\\nThe Q-Q plot is the scatterplot of the pairs\\n\\n(cid:18)x(1), Î¦\\n\\nâ1(cid:18) 1\\n\\nn + 1(cid:19)(cid:19) ,(cid:18)x(2), Î¦\\n\\nx(i) â sxÎ¦\\n\\n= z(i) â Î¦\\n\\nn + 1(cid:19) .\\nâ1(cid:18) i\\nâ1(cid:18) i\\nn + 1(cid:19) + Â¯x.\\nn + 1(cid:19)(cid:19) , . . . ,(cid:18)x(n), Î¦\\nâ1(cid:18) 2\\n\\nâ1(cid:18) n\\n\\nn + 1(cid:19)(cid:19)\\n\\nThen a good ï¬t of the data and a normal distribution can be seen in how well the plot follows a straight line with\\n\\nslope sx and vertical intercept Â¯x.

(hypergeometric) Hyper(m, n, k) (R command hyper). The hypergeometric distribution will be used in com-\\nputing probabilities under circumstances that are associated with sampling without replacement. We will use\\nthe analogy of an urn containing balls having one of two possible colors.\\nBegin with an urn holding m white balls and n black balls. Remove k and let the random variable X denote the\\nnumber of white balls. The value of X has several restrictions. X cannot be greater than either the number of\\nwhite balls, m, or the number chosen k. In addition, if k > n, then we must consider the possibility that all of\\nthe black balls were chosen. If X = x, then the number of black balls, k â x, cannot be greater than the number\\nof black balls, n, and thus, k â x â¤ n or x â¥ k â n.\\nIf we are considering equally likely outcomes, then we ï¬rst compute the total number of possible outcomes,\\n#(â¦), namely, the number of ways to choose k balls out of an urn containing m + n balls. This is the number\\nof combinations\\n\\n(cid:18)m + n\\nk (cid:19).\\n\\nThis will be the denominator for the probability. For the numerator of P{X = x}, we consider the outcomes\\nthat result in x white balls from the total number m in the urn. We must also choose k â x black balls from\\nthe total number n in the urn. By the multiplication property, the number of ways #(Ax) to accomplish this is\\nproduct of the number of outcomes for these two combinations,\\n\\nx(cid:19)(cid:18) n\\n(cid:18)m\\nk â x(cid:19).\\n\\nThe mass function for X is the ratio of these two numbers.\\n\\nfX (x|m, n, k) =\\n\\n#(Ax)\\n#(â¦)\\n\\nx(cid:1)(cid:0) n\\n= (cid:0)m\\nkâx(cid:1)\\n(cid:0)m+n\\nk (cid:1) ,\\n\\n161\\n\\nx = max{0, k â n}, . . . , min{m, k}.\\n\\n02468100.000.050.100.150.200.25xdbinom(x, 10, 0.3)02468100.000.050.100.150.20xdbinom(x, 100, 0.03)02468100.000.050.100.150.20xdbinom(x, 1000, 0.003)02468100.000.050.100.150.20xdpois(x, 3)\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nExamples of Mass Functions and Densities\\n\\nExercise 9.5.

If we were to choose the balls one-by-one re-\\nturning the balls to the urn after each choice, then we would be sampling with replacement. This returns us to\\nthe case of k Bernoulli trials with success parameter p = m/(m + n), the probability for choosing a white ball.\\nIn the case the mass function for Y , the number of white balls, is\\n\\nfY (x|m, n, k) =(cid:18)k\\n\\nx(cid:19)px(1 â p)kâx =(cid:18)k\\n\\nx(cid:19)(cid:18) m\\n\\nm + n(cid:19)x(cid:18) n\\n\\nm + n(cid:19)kâx\\n\\n=(cid:18)k\\nx(cid:19) mxnkâx\\n\\n(m + n)k .\\n\\n(9.3)\\n\\nNote that the difference in the formulas between sampling with replacement in (9.3) and without replacement in\\n(9.2) is that the powers are replaced by the falling function, e.g., mx is replaced by (m)x.\\nLet Xi be a Bernoulli random variable indicating whether or not the color of the i-th ball is white. Thus, its\\nmean\\n\\nEXi =\\n\\nm\\n\\n.\\n\\nm + n\\n\\nThe random variable for the total number of white balls X = X1 + X2 + Â·Â·Â· + Xk and thus its mean\\n\\nEX = EX1 + EX2 + Â·Â·Â· + EXk = k\\n\\nm\\n\\nm + n\\n\\n.\\n\\nBecause the selection of white for one of the marbles decreases the chance for black for another selection,\\nthe trials are not independent. One way to see this is by noting the variance (not derived here) of the sum\\nX = X1 + X2 + Â·Â·Â· + Xk\\n\\nVar(X) = k\\n\\nm\\n\\nm + n\\n\\nn\\n\\nm + n Â·\\n\\nm + n â k\\nm + n â 1\\n\\nis not the sum of the variances.\\nIf we write N = m + n for the total number of balls in the urn and p = m/(m + n) as above, then\\n\\nVar(X) = kp(1 â p)\\n\\nN â k\\nN â 1\\n\\nThus the variance of the hypergeometric random variable is reduced by a factor of (N â k)/(N â 1) from the\\ncase of the corresponding binomial random variable. In the cases for which k is much smaller than N, then\\nsampling with and without replacement are nearly the same process - any given ball is unlikely to be chosen\\nmore than once under sampling with replacement. We see this situation, for example, in a opinion poll with k at\\n1 or 2 thousand and N, the population of a country, typically many millions.\\nOn the the other hand, if k is a signiï¬cant fraction of N, then the variance is signiï¬cantly reduced under sampling\\nwithout replacement. We are much less uncertain about the fraction of white and black balls. In the extreme\\ncase of k = N, we have chosen every ball and know that X = m with probability 1. In the case, the variance\\nformula gives Var(X) = 0, as expected.\\n\\nExercise 9.6. Draw two balls without replacement from the urn described above.

The ingredient are a probability, i.e., non-negative numbers Ï1, . . . , Ïn that sum\\nto 1 and n probability density functions f1(x), . . . , fn(x) from either discrete or continuous random variables. The\\nmixture density\\n\\nf (x) = Ï1f1(x) + Â·Â·Â· + Ïnfn(x) =\\n\\nfi(x)Ïi..\\n\\nn(cid:88)i=1\\n\\nOne common version of mixtures is the case that where the density functions are taken from a particular family of\\n\\ndensities fX (x|Î¸). In other words, for the choice of n parameter values, Î¸1, . . . , Î¸n, take densities\\n\\nNext, if Î is a random variable with mass function fÎ(Î¸i) = Ïi then, we can write the mixture as\\n\\nfi(x) = fX (x|Î¸i)\\n\\nThis last sum is an expectation,\\n\\nf (x) =\\n\\nn(cid:88)i=1\\n\\nfi(x|Î¸i)fÎ(Î¸i).\\n\\nMore frequently, we see the case of a continuous mixture, Here the random variable Î is continuous with density\\n\\nfunction fÎ(Î¸) and\\n\\nf (x) = Ef (x|Î).\\n\\nf (x) = Ef (x|Î) =(cid:90) f (x|Î¸)fÎ(Î¸)dÎ¸.\\n\\nRemark 9.18. We have noted that several families of random variables, for example, the gamma random variables,\\nwere motivated by having one of its parameters taking on integral values. However, the density function makes sense\\nfor a range of real numbers. One additional case where this holds is the negative binomial family. Like the gamma\\nfamily, we use the fact that the gamma function is a generalization of the factorial function to all non-negative numbers.\\n(See identity (9.5).)

So says the statistician â Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\\n\\n10.1 Introduction\\nA public health ofï¬cial want to ascertain the mean weight of healthy newborn babies in a given region under study. If\\nwe randomly choose babies and weigh them, keeping a running average, then, because individual weights vary, at the\\nbeginning we might see some larger ï¬uctuations in our average. However, as we continue to make measurements, we\\nexpect to see this running average settle and converge to the true mean weight of newborn babies. This phenomena is\\ninformally known as the law of averages. In probability theory, we call this the law of large numbers.\\nExample 10.1. We can simulate babiesâ weights with independent normal random variables, mean 3 kg and standard\\ndeviation 0.5 kg. The following R commands perform this simulation and computes a running average of the heights.\\nThe results are displayed in Figure 10.1.\\n\\n> n<-1:100\\n> x<-rnorm(100,3,0.5)\\n> s<-cumsum(x)\\n> plot(s/n,xlab=\"n\",ylim=c(2,4),type=\"l\")\\n\\nHere, we begin with a sequence X1, X2, . . . of random variables having a common distribution. Their average, the\\n\\nsample mean,\\n\\nÂ¯X =\\n\\n1\\nn\\n\\nSn =\\n\\n1\\nn\\n\\n(X1 + X2 + Â·Â·Â· + Xn),\\n\\nis itself a random variable.\\n\\nIf the common mean for the Xiâs is Âµ, then by the linearity property of expectation, the mean of the average,\\n\\nE(cid:20) 1\\n\\nn\\n\\nSn(cid:21) =\\n\\n1\\nn\\n\\nESn =\\n\\n1\\nn\\n\\n(EX1 + EX2 + Â·Â·Â· + EXn) =\\n\\n1\\nn\\n\\n(Âµ + Âµ + Â·Â·Â· + Âµ) =\\n\\n1\\nn\\n\\nnÂµ = Âµ.\\n\\n(10.1)\\n\\nis also Âµ.\\n\\nIf, in addition, the Xiâs are independent with common variance Ï2, then ï¬rst by the quadratic identity and then the\\n\\nPythagorean identity for the variance of independent random variables, we ï¬nd that the variance of Â¯X,\\n\\nÏ2\\nÂ¯X = Var(\\n\\n1\\nn\\n\\nSn) =\\n\\n1\\nn2 (Var(X1) + Var(X2) +Â·Â·Â· + Var(Xn)) =\\n\\n1\\nn2 (Ï2 + Ï2 +Â·Â·Â· + Ï2) =\\n\\n1\\nn2 nÏ2 =\\n\\n1\\nn\\n\\nÏ2. (10.2)\\n\\nSo the mean of these running averages remains at Âµ but the variance is decreasing to 0 at a rate inversely propor-\\ntional to the number of terms in the sum. For example, the mean of the average weight of 100 newborn babies is 3\\n\\n179\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nThe Law of Large Numbers\\n\\nFigure 10.1: Four simulations of the running average Sn/n, n = 1, 2, . . . , 100 for independent normal random variables, mean 3 kg and standard\\ndeviation 0.5 kg. Notice that the running averages have large ï¬uctuations for small values of n but settle down converging to the mean value Âµ =\\n3 kilograms for newborn birth weight. This behavior could have been predicted using the law of large numbers. The size of the ï¬uctuations, as\\nmeasured by the standard deviation of Sn/n, is Ï/ân where Ï is the standard deviation of newborn birthweight.\\n\\nkilograms, the standard deviation is Ï Â¯X = Ï/ân = 0.5/â100 = 0.05 kilograms = 50 grams. For 10,000 males,\\nthe mean remains 3 kilograms, the standard deviation is Ï Â¯X = Ï/ân = 0.5/â10000 = 0.005 kilograms = 5 grams.\\nNotice that\\n\\nâ¢ as we increase n by a factor of 100,\\nâ¢ we decrease Ï Â¯X by a factor of 10.\\nThe mathematical result, the law of large numbers, tells us that the results of these simulation could have been\\n\\nanticipated.\\n\\nTheorem 10.2.

In this case the limit is\\nÂµ.\\n\\nThe theorem also states that if the random variables do not have a mean, then as the next example shows, the limit\\nwill fail to exist. We shall show with the following example. When we look at methods for estimation, one approach,\\nthe method of moments, will be based on using the law of large numbers to estimate the mean Âµ or a function of Âµ.\\n\\nCare needs to be taken to ensure that the simulated random variables indeed have a mean.

Simple Monte Carlo simulation will then frequently choose\\nvalues for g that are close to zero. These values contribute very little to the average. Due to this inefï¬ciency, a more\\nsophisticated strategy is employed. In addition, in regions where g is rapidly changing, the answer can be sensitive\\nto the choice of points in the simulation. Importance sampling methods begin with the observation that a better\\nsampling strategy may be to concentrate the random points in those regions.\\n\\nFor example, for the integral\\n\\ndx,\\n\\n(10.4)\\n\\nthe integrand rapidly changing for values near x = 0 or x = 1. (See Figure 10.4) Thus, we can hope to have a more\\naccurate estimate by concentrating our sample points in these places.\\n\\nWith this in mind, we perform the Monte Carlo integration beginning with Y1, Y2, . . . independent random vari-\\nables with common densityfY . The goal is to ï¬nd a density fY that tracks the changes in g. The density fY is called\\nthe importance sampling function or the proposal density. With this choice of density, we deï¬ne the importance\\nsampling weights so that\\n\\ng(y) = w(y)fY (y).\\n\\n(10.5)\\n\\nTo justify this choice, note that, the sample mean\\n\\nw(Y )n =\\n\\n1\\nn\\n\\nn(cid:88)i=1\\n\\nw(Yi) â(cid:90) â\\n\\nââ\\n\\nw(y)fY (y) dy =(cid:90) â\\n\\nââ\\n\\ng(y)dy = I(g).\\n\\nThus, the average of the importance sampling weights, by the strong law of large numbers, still approximates the\\nintegral of g. This is an improvement over simple Monte Carlo integration if the variance decreases, i.e.,\\n\\nVar(w(Y1)) =(cid:90) â\\n\\nââ\\n\\n(w(y) â I(g))2fY (y) dy = Ï2\\n\\nf << Ï2.\\n\\nAs the formula shows, this can be best achieved by having the weight w(y) be close to the integral I(g). Referring to\\nequation (10.5), we can now see that we should endeavor to have fY proportional to g.\\n\\nImportance leads to the following procedure for estimating integrals.\\nâ¢ Write the integrand g(x) = w(x)fY (x). Here fY is the density function for a random variable Y that is chosen\\n\\nto capture the changes in g.\\n\\nâ¢ Simulate variables Y1, Y2 . . . , Yn with density fY . This will sometimes require integrating the density function\\nâ1\\nY (u), the quantile function.\\nâ1\\nY (Ui) where U1, U2 . . . , Un, independent\\n\\nto obtain the distribution function FY (x), and then ï¬nding its inverse function F\\nThis sets up the use of the probability transform to obtain Yi = F\\nrandom variables uniformly distributed on the interval [0, 1].\\n\\nâ¢ Compute the average of w(Y1), w(Y2) . . . , w(Yn) to estimate the integral of g.\\nNote that the use of the probability transform removes the need to multiply b â a, the length of the interval.\\nExample 10.12.

Overlooking this foundation\\nmay yield results that are, at best, not useful, or harmful at worst. In any discussion of massive data\\nand inference, it is essential to be aware that it is quite possible to turn data into something resembling\\nknowledge when actually it is not. Moreover, it can be quite difï¬cult to know that this has happened. -\\npage 2, Frontiers in Massive Data Analysis by the National Research Council, 2013.\\n\\nThe balance of this book is devoted to developing formal procedures of statistical inference. In this introduction\\nto inference, we will be basing our analysis on the premise that the data have been collected according to carefully\\nplanned procedures informed by the appropriate probability models. We will focus our presentation on parametric\\nestimation and hypothesis testing based on a given family of probability models chosen in line with the science under\\ninvestigation and with the data collection procedures.\\n\\n12.1 Introduction\\nIn the simplest possible terms, the goal of estimation theory is to answer the question:\\n\\nWhat is that number?\\n\\nWhat is the length, the reaction rate, the fraction displaying a particular behavior, the temperature, the kinetic\\nenergy, the Michaelis constant, the speed of light, mutation rate, the melting point, the probability that the dominant\\nallele is expressed, the elasticity, the force, the mass, the free energy, the mean number of offspring, the focal length,\\nmean lifetime, the slope and intercept of a line?\\n\\nThe next step is to perform an experiment that is well designed to estimate one (or more) numbers. However, before\\nwe can embark on such a design, we must be informed by the principles of estimation in order to have an understanding\\nof the properties of a good estimator and to present our uncertainties concerning the estimate. Statistics has provided\\ntwo distinct approaches - typically called classical or frequentist and Bayesian. We shall give an overview of both\\napproaches. However, this text will emphasize the classical approach.\\n\\nLetâs begin with a deï¬nition:\\n\\nDeï¬nition 12.1. A statistic is a function of the data that does not depend on any unknown parameter.\\n\\nExample 12.2. We have to this point, seen a variety of statistics.\\n\\nâ¢ sample mean, Â¯x\\n\\n215\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nOverview of Estimation\\n\\nâ¢ sample variance, s2\\nâ¢ sample standard deviation, s\\nâ¢ sample median, sample quartiles Q1, Q3, percentiles and other quantiles\\nâ¢ standardized scores (xi â Â¯x)/s\\nâ¢ order statistics x(1), x(2), . . . x(n), including sample maximum and minimum\\nâ¢ sample moments\\n\\nxm =\\n\\nxm\\nk , m = 1, 2, 3, . . . .\\n\\n1\\nn\\n\\nn(cid:88)k=1\\n\\nHere, we will look at a particular type of parameter estimation, in which we consider X = (X1, . . . , Xn), inde-\\npendent random variables chosen according to one of a family of probabilities PÎ¸ where Î¸ is element from the param-\\neter space Î. Based on our analysis, we choose an estimator ËÎ¸(X). If the data x takes on the values x1, x2, . . . , xn,\\nthen\\n\\nËÎ¸(x1, x2, . . . , xn)\\n\\nis called the estimate of Î¸. Thus we have three closely related objects,\\n\\n1. Î¸ - the parameter, an element of the parameter space Î. This is a number or a vector.\\n\\n2. ËÎ¸(x1, x2, . . . , xn) - the estimate. This again is a number or a vector obtained by evaluating the estimator on the\\n\\ndata x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn).\\n\\n3. ËÎ¸(X1, . . . , Xn) - the estimator. This is a random variable. We will analyze the distribution of this random\\n\\nvariable to decide how well it performs in estimating Î¸.\\n\\nThe ï¬rst of these three objects is a number. The second is a statistic. The third can be analyzed and its properties\\ndescribed using the theory of probability. Keeping the relationship among these three objects in mind is essential in\\nunderstanding the fundamental issues in statistical estimation.\\n\\nExample 12.3. For Bernoulli trials X = (X1, . . . , Xn), each Xi, i = 1, . . . , n can take only two values 0 and 1. We\\nhave\\n\\n1. p, a single parameter, the probability of success, with parameter space [0, 1]. This is the probability that a single\\n\\nBernoulli takes on the value 1.\\n\\n2. Ëp(x1, . . . , xn) is the sample proportion of successes in the data set.\\n\\n3. Ëp(X1, . . . , Xn), the sample mean of the random variables\\n\\nËp(X1, . . . , Xn) =\\n\\n1\\nn\\n\\n(X1 + Â·Â·Â· + Xn) =\\n\\n1\\nn\\n\\nSn\\n\\nis an estimator of p. In this case the Xi are Bernoulli trials. Consequently, we can give the distribution of this\\nestimator because Sn is a binomial random variable.\\n\\nExample 12.4. Given pairs of observations (x, y) = ((x1, y1), (x2, y2), . . . , (xn, yn)) that display a general linear\\npattern, we use ordinary least squares regressn for\\n\\n1. parameters - the slope Î² and intercept Î± of the regression line. So, the parameter space is R2, pairs of real\\n\\nnumbers.\\n\\n216\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nOverview of Estimation\\n\\n2. They are estimated using the statistics ËÎ² and ËÎ± in the equations\\n\\nËÎ²(x, y) =\\n\\ncov(x, y)\\n\\nvar(x)\\n\\n,\\n\\nÂ¯y = ËÎ±(x, y) + ËÎ²(x, y)Â¯x.\\n\\n3. Later, when we consider statistical inference for linear regression, we will analyze the distribution of the esti-\\n\\nmators.\\n\\nExercise 12.5. Let X = (X1, . . . , Xn) be independent uniform random variables on the interval [0, Î¸] with Î¸ un-\\nknown. Give some estimators of Î¸ from the statistics above.\\n\\n12.2 Classical Statistics\\nIn classical statistics, the state of nature is assumed to be ï¬xed, but unknown to us. Thus, one goal of estimation is to\\ndetermine which of the PÎ¸ is the source of the data. The estimate is a statistic\\n\\nËÎ¸ : data â Î.\\n\\nIntroduction to estimation in the classical approach to statistics is based on two fundamental questions:\\nâ¢ How do we determine estimators?\\nâ¢ How do we evaluate estimators?\\nWe can ask if this estimator in any way systematically under or over estimate the parameter, if it has large or small\\nvariance, and how does it compare to a notion of best possible estimator. How easy is it to determine and to compute\\nand how does the procedure improve with increased sample size?\\n\\nThe raw material for our analysis of any estimator is the distribution of the random variables that underlie the\\ndata under any possible value Î¸ of the parameter.

For the next three topics, we consider two approaches\\nfor determining estimators - method of moments and maximum likelihood.\\nIn between the introduction of these\\ntwo estimation procedures, we will develop analyses of the quality of the estimator. With this in view, we will\\nprovide methods for approximating the bias and the variance of the estimators. Typically, this information is, in\\npart, summarized though what is know as an interval estimator. This is a procedure that determines a subset of the\\nparameter space with high probability that it contains the real state of nature. We see this most frequently in the use of\\nconï¬dence intervals.\\n\\n12.3 Bayesian Statistics\\nFor a few tosses of a coin always that always turn up tails, the estimate Ëp = 0 for the probability of heads did not\\nseem reasonable to Thomas Bayes. He wanted a way to place our uncertainly of the value for p into the procedure for\\nestimation.\\n\\nToday, the Bayesian approach to statistics takes into account not only the density\\n\\nfX|Î(x|Ï)\\n\\nfor the data collected for any given experiment but also external information to determine a prior density Ï on the\\nparameter space Î. Thus, in this approach, both the parameter and the data are modeled as random. Estimation is\\nbased on Bayes formula. We now want to take Bayes theorem, previously derived for a ï¬nite partition and obtain a\\nformula useful for Bayesian estimation. The ï¬rst step will yield a formula based on a discrete mixture. We will then\\nneed to introduce the notion of a continuous mixture to give us the ï¬nal formula, (12.4).\\n\\n218\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nOverview of Estimation\\n\\nr\\n\\nFigure 12.1: Plot of density Ï(Ï) in black for continuous mixture and the approximating discrete mixture with weights ËÏ( ËÏ) proportional to the\\nheights of the red vertical lines.\\n\\nLet ËÎ be a random variable having the given prior density Ï. In the case in which both ËÎ and the data take on only\\n\\na ï¬nite set of values, ËÎ is a discrete random variable and Ï is a mass function\\n\\nÏ{Ï} = P{ ËÎ = Ï}.\\n\\nLet CÏ = { ËÎ = Ï} be the event that ËÎ takes on the value Ï and A = {X = x} be the values taken on by the data.\\nThen {CÏ, Ï â Î} form a partition of the probability space.

As we learned in tte section on Random Variables and Distribution functions, the expression\\n\\n(cid:88)Ï\\n\\nfX|Î(x|Ï)Ï{Ï}\\n\\nis the mixture of the densities fX|Î(x|Ï) for Ï in the ï¬nite set with weights Ï(Ï). Typically the parameter space Î\\nis continuous and so we want to use the density Ï of a continuous random variable. To determine an expression for a\\ncontinuous mixture, we will be guided by the ideas used deriving the formula for the expected value for a continuous\\nrandom variable based on the formula for a discrete random variable. Beginning with the property\\n\\n(cid:90)Î¸\\n\\nÏ(Ï)dÏ = 1 we have, for a Riemann sum, (cid:88)ËÏ\\n\\nÏ( ËÏ)âÏ â 1.\\n\\nNow, write\\n\\nËÏ{ ËÏ} = Ï( ËÏ)âÏ.\\n\\n219\\n\\n(12.2)\\n\\n-1.0-0.50.00.51.00.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.7psidensity-1.0-0.50.00.51.00.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.7\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nOverview of Estimation\\n\\nThen ËÏ is (approximately) the density function for a discrete random variable. If we take a mixture of fX|Î(x| ËÏ)\\n\\nwith weights ËÏ( ËÏ), we have the mixture density\\n\\n(cid:88)ËÏ\\n\\nfX|Î(x|Ï)ËÏ{ ËÏ} =(cid:88)ËÏ\\n\\nfX|Î(x|Ï)Ï( ËÏ)âÏ.\\n\\nThis last sum is a Riemann sum and so taking limits as âÏ â 0, we have that the Riemann sum converges to the\\ndeï¬nite integral. This gives us the continuous mixture\\n\\nfX (x) =(cid:90)Î\\n\\nfX|Î(x|Ï)Ï(Ï) dÏ.\\n\\n(12.3)\\n\\nExercise 12.9. Show that the expression (12.3) for fX (x) is a valid density function\\n\\nReturning to the expression (12.1), substituting (12.2), we have in the interval from Î¸ to Î¸ + âÎ¸,\\n\\nfÎ|X (Î¸|x)âÎ¸ =\\n\\nfX|Î(x|Î¸)Ï(Î¸)âÎ¸\\n\\n(cid:80)Ï fX|Î(x|Ï)Ï(Ï)âÏ\\n\\n.\\n\\nAfter dividing by âÎ¸ and taking a limit as âÏ â 0, we have, for Ï, a density for a continuous random variable, that\\nthe sum in Bayes formula becomes an integral for a continuous mixture,\\nfX|Î(x|Î¸)Ï(Î¸)\\n\\n(12.4)\\n\\nSometimes we shall write (12.4) as\\n\\nfÎ|X (Î¸|x) =\\n\\n(cid:82) fX|Î(x|Ï)Ï(Ï) dÏ\\n\\nfÎ|X (Î¸|x) = c(x)fX|Î(x|Î¸)Ï(Î¸)\\n\\nwhere c(x), the reciprocal of continuous mixture (12.3) in the denominator of (12.4), is the value necessary so that the\\nintegral of the posterior density fÎ|X (Î¸|x) with respect to Î¸ equals 1. We might also write\\n\\nfÎ|X (Î¸|x) â fX|Î(x|Î¸)Ï(Î¸)\\n\\n(12.5)\\n\\nwhere c(x) is the constant of proportionality.\\n\\nEstimation, e.g., point and interval estimates, in the Bayesian approach is based on the data and an analysis using\\nthe posterior density. For example, one way to estimate Î¸ is to use the mean of the posterior distribution, or more\\nbrieï¬y, the posterior mean,\\n\\nËÎ¸(x) = E[Î¸|x] =(cid:90) Î¸fÎ|X (Î¸|x) dÎ¸.\\n\\nExample 12.10. As suggested in the original question of Thomas Bayes, we will make independent ï¬ips of a biased\\ncoin and use a Bayesian approach to make some inference for the probability of heads. We ï¬rst need to set a prior\\ndistribution for ËP . The beta family Beta(Î±, Î²) of distributions takes values in the interval [0, 1] and provides a\\nconvenient prior density Ï. Thus,\\n\\nÏ(p) = cÎ±,Î²p(Î±â1)(1 â p)(Î²â1),\\n\\n0 < p < 1.\\n\\nAny density on the interval [0, 1] that can be written a a power of p times a power of 1 â p times a constant chosen so\\nthat\\n\\nis a member of the beta family.

If the two parameters are each multiplied by a factor of k, then the\\nmean does not change. However, the variance is reduced by a factor close to k. The prior gives a sense of our prior\\nknowledge of the mean through the ratio of Î± to Î± + Î² and our uncertainly through the size of Î± and Î²\\n\\nThus the posterior distribution of the parameter ËP given the data x, using (12.5), we have.\\n\\nIf we perform n Bernoulli trials, x = (x1, . . . , xn), then the joint density\\n\\n(cid:80)n\\nk=1 xk (1 â p)nâ(cid:80)n\\nfX (x|p) = p\\n(cid:80)n\\nk=1 xk (1 â p)nâ(cid:80)n\\n= cÎ±,Î²pÎ±+(cid:80)n\\nf ËP|X (p|x) â fX| ËP (x|p)Ï(p) = p\\n\\nk=1 xk .\\n\\nk=1 xk Â· cÎ±,Î²p(Î±â1)(1 â p)(Î²â1).\\n\\nk=1 xkâ1(1 â p)Î²+nâ(cid:80)n\\n\\nk=1 xkâ1.\\n\\nConsequently, the posterior distribution is also from the beta family with parameters\\n\\nÎ± +\\n\\nn(cid:88)k=1\\n\\nxk\\n\\nand Î² + n â\\n\\nxk = Î² +\\n\\nn(cid:88)k=1\\n\\nn(cid:88)k=1\\n\\n(1 â xk).\\n\\nÎ± + # successes\\n\\nand Î² + # failures.\\n\\nNotice that the posterior mean can be written as\\n\\nÎ± +(cid:80)n\\n\\nk=1 xk\\nÎ± + Î² + n\\n\\n=\\n\\n=\\n\\n=\\n\\nÎ±\\n\\nÎ± + Î² + n\\n\\n+ (cid:80)n\\n\\nk=1 xk\\nÎ± + Î² + n\\n\\nÎ±\\n\\nÎ± + Î² Â·\\n\\nÎ±\\n\\nÎ± + Î² Â·\\n\\nÎ± + Î²\\n\\nÎ± + Î² + n\\n\\nÎ± + Î²\\n\\nÎ± + Î² + n\\n\\n+\\n\\n1\\nn\\n\\nn(cid:88)k=1\\n\\nxk Â·\\nn\\n\\n+ Â¯x Â·\\n\\nÎ± + Î² + n\\n\\n.\\n\\nn\\n\\nÎ± + Î² + n\\n\\nThis expression allow us to see that the posterior mean can be expresses as a weighted average Î±/(Î± + Î²) from the\\nprior mean and Â¯x, the sample mean from the data. The relative weights are\\n\\nÎ± + Î² from the prior\\n\\nand\\n\\nn, the number of observations.\\n\\nThus, if the number of observations n is small compared to Î± + Î², then most of the weight is placed on the prior\\n\\nmean Î±/(Î± + Î²). As the number of observations n increase, then\\n\\nn\\n\\nÎ± + Î² + n\\n\\nincreases towards 1. The weight result in a shift the posterior mean away from the prior mean and towards the sample\\nmean Â¯x.\\n\\nThis brings forward two central issues in the use of the Bayesian approach to estimation.\\nâ¢ If the number of observations is small, then the estimate relies heavily on the quality of the choice of the prior\\n\\ndistribution Ï. Thus, an unreliable choice for Ï leads to an unreliable estimate.\\n\\nâ¢ As the number of observations increases, the estimate relies less and less on the prior distribution.\\n\\nIn this\\ncircumstance, the prior may simply be playing the roll of a catalyst that allows the machinery of the Bayesian\\nmethodology to proceed.\\n\\nExercise 12.11.

One estimation technique is to capture some of the animals, mark them and release them back\\ninto the wild to mix randomly with the population.\\n\\nSome time later, a second capture from the population is made. In this case, some of the animals were not in the\\n\\nï¬rst capture and some, which are tagged, are recaptured. Let\\n\\nâ¢ t be the number captured and tagged,\\nâ¢ k be the number in the second capture,\\nâ¢ r be the number in the second capture that are tagged, and let\\nâ¢ N be the total population size.\\nThus, both t and k are under the control of the experimenter. The value of r is random and the populations size\\nN is the parameter to be estimated. We will use a method of moments strategy to estimate N. First, note that we can\\nguess the the estimate of N by considering two proportions.\\n\\nthe proportion of the tagged ï¬sh in the second capture â the proportion of tagged ï¬sh in the population\\n\\nr\\nk â\\n\\nt\\nN\\n\\nThis can be solved for N to ï¬nd N â kt/r.

Letâs examine this by looking a the computation of the mean and the variance of 16 ï¬ips of a\\nfair coin.\\n\\nGive this task to 10 individuals and ask them report the number of heads. We can simulate this in R as follows .\\n\\n> (x<-rbinom(10,16,0.5))\\n\\n[1]\\n\\n8 5 9 7 7 9 7 8 8 10\\n\\nOur estimate is obtained by taking these 10 answers and averaging them. Intuitively we anticipate an answer\\n\\naround 8. For these 10 observations, we ï¬nd, in this case, that\\n\\n> sum(x)/10\\n[1] 7.8\\n\\nThe result is a bit below 8. Is this systematic? To assess this, we appeal to the ideas behind Monte Carlo to twice\\n\\nperform a 1000 simulations of the example above.\\n\\n> meanx<-replicate(1000,mean(rbinom(10,16,0.5)))\\n> mean(meanx)\\n[1] 7.9799\\n> meanx<-replicate(1000,mean(rbinom(10,16,0.5)))\\n> mean(meanx)\\n[1] 8.0049\\n\\nFrom this, we surmise that we the estimate of the sample mean Â¯x neither systematically overestimates or un-\\nderestimates the distributional mean. From our knowledge of the binomial distribution, we know that the mean\\nÂµ = np = 16 Â· 0.5 = 8. In addition, the sample mean Â¯X also has mean\\n\\nE Â¯X =\\n\\n1\\n10\\n\\n(8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8) =\\n\\n80\\n10\\n\\n= 8\\n\\nverifying that we have no systematic error.\\n\\nThe phrase that we use is that the sample mean Â¯X is an unbiased estimator of the distributional mean Âµ. Here is\\n\\nthe precise deï¬nition.\\nDeï¬nition 14.1. For observations X = (X1, X2, . . . , Xn) based on a distribution having parameter value Î¸, and for\\nd(X) an estimator for k(Î¸), the bias is the mean of the difference d(X) â k(Î¸), i.e.,\\n\\nbd(Î¸) = EÎ¸d(X) â k(Î¸).\\n\\n241\\n\\n(14.1)\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nUnbiased Estimation\\n\\nIf bd(Î¸) = 0 for all values of the parameter, then d(X) is called an unbiased estimator. Any estimator that is not\\nunbiased is called biased.\\nExample 14.2. Let X1, X2, . . . , Xn be Bernoulli trials with success parameter p and set the estimator for p to be\\nd(X) = Â¯X, the sample mean. Then,\\n\\nEp Â¯X =\\n\\n1\\nn\\n\\n(EX1 + EX2 + Â·Â·Â· + EXn) =\\n\\n1\\nn\\n\\n(p + p + Â·Â·Â· + p) = p\\n\\nThus, Â¯X is an unbiased estimator for p. In this circumstance, we generally write Ëp instead of Â¯X. In addition, we can\\nuse the fact that for independent random variables, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances to see that\\n\\nVar(Ëp) =\\n\\n=\\n\\n1\\nn2 (Var(X1) + Var(X2) + Â·Â·Â· + Var(Xn))\\n1\\nn2 (p(1 â p) + p(1 â p) + Â·Â·Â· + p(1 â p)) =\\n\\n1\\nn\\n\\np(1 â p).\\n\\nExample 14.3. If X1, . . . , Xn form a simple random sample with unknown ï¬nite mean Âµ, then Â¯X is an unbiased\\nestimator of Âµ. If the Xi have variance Ï2, then\\n\\nVar( Â¯X) =\\n\\nÏ2\\nn\\n\\n.\\n\\nWe can assess the quality of an estimator by computing its mean square error, deï¬ned by\\n\\nEÎ¸[(d(X) â k(Î¸))2].\\n\\n(14.2)\\n\\n(14.3)\\n\\nEstimators with smaller mean square error are generally preferred to those with larger. Next we derive a simple\\nrelationship between mean square error and variance. If we write Y = d(X) â k(Î¸) in (14.3) and recall that the\\nvariance VarÎ¸(Y ) = EÎ¸Y 2 â (EÎ¸Y )2 .\\n\\nThen\\n\\nEÎ¸Y = EÎ¸(d(X) â k(Î¸)) = EÎ¸d(X) â k(Î¸) = bd(Î¸)\\n\\nand the mean square error\\n\\nand VarÎ¸(Y ) = VarÎ¸(d(X))\\n\\nEÎ¸[(d(X) â k(Î¸))2] = EÎ¸Y 2 = Var(Y ) + (EY )2 = VarÎ¸(d(X)) + bd(Î¸)2\\n\\n(14.4)\\nThus, the representation of the mean square error as equal to the variance of the estimator plus the square of the\\nbias is called the bias-variance decomposition. Mean square error can be considered as a measure of the accuracy\\nof an estimator. If the variance is small, then we can say that the estimator is precise. It may still not be very accurate\\nif the bias is large, but will be accurate only if the estimator is both precise and has low bias. In addition:\\n\\nâ¢ The mean square error for an unbiased estimator is its variance.\\nâ¢ Bias always increases the mean square error.\\n\\n14.2 Computing Bias\\nFor the variance Ï2, we have been presented with two choices:\\n\\n1\\nn\\n\\nn(cid:88)i=1\\n\\n(xi â Â¯x)2\\n\\nand\\n\\n1\\n\\nn â 1\\n\\nn(cid:88)i=1\\n\\n(xi â Â¯x)2.\\n\\n(14.5)\\n\\nUsing bias as our criterion, we can now resolve between the two choices for the estimators for the variance Ï2.\\nAgain, we use simulations to make a conjecture, we then follow up with a computation to verify our guess.

We have seen, in the case of n Bernoulli trials having x successes, that Ëp = x/n is an unbiased\\nestimator for the parameter p. This is the case, for example, in taking a simple random sample of genetic markers at\\na particular biallelic locus. (A locus with exactly two alleles.) Let one allele denote the wildtype (the typical alleles\\nas it occurs in nature) and the second a variant. If the circumstances in which variant is recessive, then an individual\\nexpresses the variant phenotype only in the case that both chromosomes contain this marker. In the case of independent\\nalleles from each parent, the probability of the variant phenotype is p2. NaÂ¨Ä±vely, we could use the estimator Ëp2.

If g is a convex function, we\\ncan say something about the bias of this estimator. In Figure 14.2, we see the method of moments estimator for the\\nestimator g( Â¯X) for a parameter Î² in the Pareto distribution. The choice of Î² = 3 corresponds to a mean of Âµ = 3/2 for\\nthe Pareto random variables. The central limit theorem states that the sample mean Â¯X is nearly normally distributed\\nwith mean 3/2. Thus, the distribution of Â¯X is nearly symmetric around 3/2. From the ï¬gure, we can see that the\\ninterval from 1.4 to 1.5 under the function g maps into a longer interval above Î² = 3 than the interval from 1.5 to 1.6\\nmaps below Î² = 3. Thus, the function g spreads the values of Â¯X above Î² = 3 more than below. Consequently, we\\nanticipate that the estimator ËÎ² will be upwardly biased.\\n\\nTo address this phenomena in more general terms, we use the characterization of a convex function as a differen-\\ntiable function whose graph lies above any tangent line. If we look at the value Âµ for the convex function g, then this\\nstatement becomes\\n\\nNow replace x with the random variable Â¯X and take expectations.\\n\\ng(x) â g(Âµ) â¥ g\\n\\n(Âµ)(x â Âµ).\\n\\n(cid:48)\\n\\nEÂµ[g( Â¯X) â g(Âµ)] â¥ EÂµ[g\\n\\n(cid:48)\\n\\n(Âµ)( Â¯X â Âµ)] = g\\n\\n(cid:48)\\n\\n(Âµ)EÂµ[ Â¯X â Âµ] = 0.\\n\\nConsequently,\\n\\n(14.7)\\n\\nand g( Â¯X) is biased upwards. The expression in (14.7) is known as Jensenâs inequality.\\nExercise 14.8.

Note that the tangent line is below the graph of g. Here we show the case in which Âµ = 1.5 and\\nÎ² = g(Âµ) = 3. Notice that the interval from x = 1.4 to x = 1.5 has a longer range than the interval from x = 1.5 to x = 1.6 Because g spreads\\nthe values of Â¯X above Î² = 3 more than below, the estimator ËÎ² for Î² is biased upward. We can use a second order Taylor series expansion to correct\\nmost of this bias.\\n\\nTo estimate the size of the bias, we look at a quadratic approximation for g centered at the value Âµ\\n\\nAgain, replace x in this expression with the random variable Â¯X and then take expectations.

Based on the variance-bias identity in (14.3), we use the delta method to\\napproximate VarÎ¸(g( Â¯X)) and (14.8) to approximate the bias. Consequently,\\n\\nEÎ¸[(ËÎ¸(X) â Î¸)2] = EÎ¸[(g( Â¯X) â g(Âµ))2] = VarÎ¸(g( Â¯X)) + bg(Âµ)2 â g\\n\\n(cid:48)\\n\\n(Âµ)2 Ï2\\nn\\n\\n+\\n\\n(cid:48)(cid:48)\\n\\n1\\n\\n4(cid:18)g\\n\\n(Âµ)\\n\\nÏ2\\n\\nn(cid:19)2\\n\\n.\\n\\nFinally, we make the substitution Âµ = k(Î¸) to give an expression for the approximation of the mean square error for\\nËÎ¸ as a function of Î¸.

Given data X1, X2, . . . and a real valued function h of the parameter space, a sequence of estima-\\ntors dn, based on the ï¬rst n observations, is called consistent if for every choice of Î¸\\n\\nwhenever Î¸ is the true state of nature.\\n\\nlim\\nnââ dn(X1, X2, . . . , Xn) = k(Î¸)\\n\\nThus, the bias of the estimator disappears in the limit of a large number of observations. In addition, the distribution\\n\\nof the estimators dn(X1, X2, . . . , Xn) become more and more concentrated near k(Î¸).\\n\\nFor the next example, we need to recall the sequence deï¬nition of continuity: A function g is continuous at a real\\n\\nnumber x provided that for every sequence {xn; n â¥ 1} with\\n\\nxn â x, then, we have that g(xn) â g(x).\\n\\nA function is called continuous if it is continuous at every value of x in the domain of g. Thus, we can write the\\nexpression above more succinctly by saying that for every convergent sequence {xn; n â¥ 1},\\n\\nnââ g(xn) = g( lim\\nlim\\n\\nnââ xn).\\n\\nExample 14.17. For a method of moment estimator, letâs focus on the case of a single parameter (d = 1). For\\nindependent observations, X1, X2, . . . , having mean Âµ = k(Î¸), we have that\\n\\nE Â¯Xn = Âµ,\\n\\n249\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nUnbiased Estimation\\n\\ni. e. Â¯Xn, the sample mean for the ï¬rst n observations, is an unbiased estimator for Âµ = k(Î¸). Also, by the law of large\\nnumbers, we have that\\n\\nAssume that k has a continuous inverse g = kâ1. In particular, because Âµ = k(Î¸), we have that g(Âµ) = Î¸. Next,\\n\\nusing the methods of moments procedure, deï¬ne, for n observations, the estimators\\n\\nlim\\nnââ\\n\\nÂ¯Xn = Âµ.\\n\\nËÎ¸n(X1, X2, . . . , Xn) = g(cid:18) 1\\n\\nn\\n\\n(X1 + Â·Â·Â· + Xn)(cid:19) = g( Â¯Xn).\\n\\nfor the parameter Î¸.

This section gives us an introduction to\\nthe log-likelihood and its derivative, the score functions. We shall encounter these functions again when we introduce\\nmaximum likelihood estimation. In addition, the CramÂ´er Rao bound, which is based on the variance of the score\\nfunction, known as the Fisher information, gives a lower bound for the variance of an unbiased estimator. These\\nconcepts will be necessary to describe the variance for maximum likelihood estimators.\\n\\nAmong unbiased estimators, one important goal is to ï¬nd an estimator that has as small a variance as possible, A\\nmore precise goal would be to ï¬nd an unbiased estimator d that has uniform minimum variance. In other words,\\nd(X) has has a smaller variance than for any other unbiased estimator Ëd for every value Î¸ of the parameter.\\n\\nfor all Î¸ â Î.\\nThe efï¬ciency e( Ëd) of unbiased estimator Ëd is the minimum value of the ratio\\n\\nVarÎ¸d(X) â¤ VarÎ¸ Ëd(X)\\n\\nVarÎ¸d(X)\\nVarÎ¸ Ëd(X)\\n\\nover all values of Î¸. Thus, the efï¬ciency is between 0 and 1 with a goal of ï¬nding estimators with efï¬ciency as near to\\none as possible.\\n\\nFor unbiased estimators, the CramÂ´er-Rao bound tells us how small a variance is ever possible. The formula is a bit\\nmysterious at ï¬rst. However, we shall soon learn that this bound is a consequence of the bound on correlation that we\\nhave previously learned\\n\\nRecall that for two random variables Y and Z, the correlation\\n\\ntakes values between -1 and 1.

A. Fisher, Phil. Trans. Royal Soc.\\nSer. A. 222, (1922),\\n\\n15.1 Introduction\\n\\nThe principle of maximum likelihood is relatively straightforward to state. As before, we begin with observations\\nX = (X1, . . . , Xn) of random variables chosen according to one of a family of probabilities PÎ¸. In addition, f (x|Î¸),\\nx = (x1, . . . , xn) will be used to denote the density function for the data when Î¸ is the true state of nature.\\nThen, the principle of maximum likelihood yields a choice of the estimator ËÎ¸ as the value for the parameter that\\n\\nmakes the observed data most probable.\\n\\nDeï¬nition 15.1. The likelihood function is the density function regarded as a function of Î¸.\\n\\nThe maximum likelihood estimate (MLE),\\n\\nL(Î¸|x) = f (x|Î¸), Î¸ â Î.\\n\\nËÎ¸(x) = arg max\\n\\nÎ¸\\n\\nL(Î¸|x).\\n\\n(15.1)\\n\\n(15.2)\\n\\nThus, we are presuming that a unique global maximum exists.\\nWe will learn that especially for large samples, the maximum likelihood estimators have many desirable properties.\\nHowever, especially for high dimensional data, the likelihood can have many local maxima. Thus, ï¬nding the global\\nmaximum can be a major computational challenge.\\n\\nThis class of estimators has an important invariance property. If ËÎ¸(x) is a maximum likelihood estimate for\\nÎ¸, then g(ËÎ¸(x)) is a maximum likelihood estimate for g(Î¸). For example, if Î¸ is a parameter for the variance and ËÎ¸\\n\\ndeviation. This ï¬exibility in estimation criterion seen here is not available in the case of unbiased estimators.\\n\\nis the maximum likelihood estimate for the variance, then(cid:112)ËÎ¸ is the maximum likelihood estimate for the standard\\nFor independent observations, the likelihood is the product of density functions. Because the logarithm of a product\\nis the sum of the logarithms, ï¬nding zeroes of the score function, â ln L(Î¸|x)/âÎ¸, the derivative of the logarithm of\\nthe likelihood, will be easier. Having the parameter values be the variable of interest is somewhat unusual, so we will\\nnext look at several examples of the likelihood function.\\n\\n261\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nMaximum Likelihood Estimation\\n\\nFigure 15.1: Likelihood function (top row) and its logarithm (bottom row) for Bernoulli trials. The left column is based on 20 trials having 8 and\\n11 successes. The right column is based on 40 trials having 16 and 22 successes. Notice that the maximum likelihood is approximately 10â6 for 20\\ntrials and 10â12 for 40. In addition, note that the peaks are more narrow for 40 trials rather than 20. We shall later be able to associate this property\\nto the variance of the maximum likelihood estimator.\\n\\n262\\n\\n0.20.30.40.50.60.70.0e+005.0e-071.0e-061.5e-06pl0.20.30.40.50.60.70.0e+005.0e-071.0e-061.5e-06pl0.20.30.40.50.60.70.0e+001.0e-122.0e-12pl0.20.30.40.50.60.70.0e+001.0e-122.0e-12pl0.20.30.40.50.60.7-20-18-16-14plog(l)0.20.30.40.50.60.7-20-18-16-14plog(l)0.20.30.40.50.60.7-33-31-29-27plog(l)0.20.30.40.50.60.7-33-31-29-27plog(l)\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nMaximum Likelihood Estimation\\n\\n15.2 Examples\\nExample 15.2 (Bernoulli trials).

Recall from the discussion of the CramÂ´er-Rao bound, that the estimator ËÎ· is efï¬cient.\\nIn other, words, if we have n independent observations from the density fX (x|Î·), then ËÎ· is an unbiased estimator of Î·\\nwith\\n\\nVarÎ·(ËÎ·(X)) =\\n\\n1\\n\\nnI(Î·)\\n\\nReturning to the parameter space with Î¸ â Î and the form of the exponential family with\\n\\nwe can use the invariance property of the the maximum likelihood estimate to say that\\n\\nfX (x|Î¸) = c(Î·(Î¸))h(x) exp(Î·(Î¸)T (x)),\\n\\nËÎ¸(x) = Î·\\n\\nâ1(g(T (x)))\\n\\nprovided that Î· is a one-to-one function and thus has an inverse function Î·â1.\\nExercise 15.16.

Thus far, we have computed\\n\\nmoments using the density\\n\\nEÎ¸X m =(cid:90) â\\n\\nââ\\n\\nxmfX (x|Î¸) dx.\\n\\nHowever, consider the case of determining parameters in the distribution in the number of proteins in a tissue. If\\n\\nthe tissue has several cell types, then we would need\\n\\nâ¢ the distribution of cell types, and\\nâ¢ a density function for the number of proteins in each cell type.\\nThese two pieces of information can be used to calculate the mean and variance for the number of cells with some\\nease. However, giving an explicit expression for the density and hence the likelihood function is more difï¬cult to\\nobtain. This leads to quite intricate computations to carry out the desired analysis of the likelihood function.\\n\\n15.9 Technical Aspects\\nWe can use concepts previously introduced to obtain the properties for the maximum likelihood estimator. For exam-\\nple, Î¸0 is more likely that a another parameter value Î¸\\n\\nL(Î¸0|X) > L(Î¸|X)\\n\\nif and only if\\n\\nln\\n\\nf (Xi|Î¸0)\\nf (Xi|Î¸)\\n\\n> 0.\\n\\nBy the strong law of large numbers, this sum converges to\\n\\n1\\nn\\n\\nn(cid:88)i=1\\nf (X1|Î¸)(cid:21) .\\n\\nf (X1|Î¸0)\\n\\nEÎ¸0(cid:20)ln\\n\\nwhich is greater than 0. thus, for a large number of observations and a given value of Î¸, then with a probability nearly\\none, L(Î¸0|X) > L(Î¸|X) and so the maximum likelihood estimator has a high probability of being very near Î¸0. This\\nis a statement of the consistency of the estimator.\\n\\nFor the asymptotic normality and efï¬ciency, we write the linear approximation of the score function\\n\\nd\\ndÎ¸\\n\\nln L(Î¸|X) â\\n\\nd\\ndÎ¸\\n\\nln L(Î¸0|X) + (Î¸ â Î¸0)\\n\\nd2\\ndÎ¸2 ln L(Î¸0|X).\\n\\nNow substitute Î¸ = ËÎ¸ and note that d\\n\\ndÎ¸ ln L(ËÎ¸|X) = 0.

Often, we\\nknow more about the distribution of the estimator and this allows us to take a more comprehensive statement about the\\nestimation procedure.\\n\\nInterval estimation is an exteneion to the variety of techniques we have examined. Given data x, we replace the\\npoint estimate ËÎ¸(x) for the parameter Î¸ by a statistic that is subset ËC(x) of the parameter space. We will consider both\\nthe classical and Bayesian approaches to choosing ËC(x). As we shall learn, the two approaches have very different\\ninterpretations.\\n\\n16.1 Classical Statistics\\nIn this case, the random set ËC(X) is chosen to have a prescribed high probability, Î³, of containing the true parameter\\nvalue Î¸. In symbols,\\n\\nPÎ¸{Î¸ â ËC(X)} = Î³.\\n\\nIn this case, the set ËC(x) is called a Î³-level conï¬dence set.\\nIn the case of a one dimensional parameter set, the typical choice\\nof conï¬dence set is a conï¬dence interval\\n\\nËC(x) = (ËÎ¸(cid:96)(x), ËÎ¸u(x)).\\n\\nOften this interval takes the form\\nËC(x) = (ËÎ¸(x) â m(x), ËÎ¸(x) + m(x)) = ËÎ¸(x) Â± m(x)\\n\\nwhere the two statistics,\\n\\nâ¢ ËÎ¸(x) is a point estimate, and\\nâ¢ m(x) is the margin of error.\\n\\nFigure 16.1: Upper tail critical values.

So, let X1, X2,Â·Â·Â· , Xn be normal random\\nvariables with unknown mean and unknown standard deviation. Let S2 be the unbiased sample variance. If we are\\nforced to replace the unknown variance Ï2 with its unbiased estimate s2, then the statistic is known as t:\\n\\nThe term s/ân which estimates the standard deviation of the sample mean is called the standard error. The\\n\\nremarkable discovery by William Gossett is that the distribution of the t statistic can be determined exactly.

Gossett,\\nwho worked for the the brewery of Arthur Guinness in Dublin, was permitted to publish his results only if it appeared\\nunder a pseudonym. Gosset chose the name Student, thus the distribution is sometimes known as Studentâs t.\\n\\nFigure 16.2: The density and distribution function for a standard normal random variable (black) and a t random variable with 4 degrees of freedom\\n(red).

A level Î³ conï¬dence interval for a population parameter Î¸ is an interval computed\\nfrom the sample data having probability Î³ of producing an interval containing Î¸.\\n\\nFor an estimate of a population mean or proportion, a level Î³ conï¬dence interval often has the form\\n\\nâ\\n\\nestimate Â± t\\n\\nÃ standard error\\n\\nwhere tâ is the upper 1âÎ³\\ncritical value for the t distribution with the appropriate number of degrees of freedom.

If we can assume that the two samples\\nhave a common standard deviation, then we pool the data to compute sp, the pooled standard deviation. Matched pair\\nprocedures use a one sample procedure on the difference in the observed values.\\n\\nFor these intervals, we need a sample size large enough so that the central limit theorem is a sufï¬ciently good\\napproximation. For one population tests for means, n > 30 and data not strongly skewed is a good rule of thumb. For\\ntwo population tests, 40 observations for each group may be necessary. For population proportions, we ask that the\\nmean number of successes np and the mean number of failures n(1 â p) each be at least 10.\\nvalues of the explanatory variable.\\n\\nFor the standard error for ËÎ² in linear regression, su is deï¬ned in (16.2) and sx is the standard deviation of the\\n\\nInterpretation of the Conï¬dence Interval\\n\\n16.1.5\\nThe conï¬dence interval for a parameter Î¸ is based on two statistics - ËÎ¸(cid:96)(x), the lower end of the conï¬dence interval\\nand ËÎ¸u(x), the upper end of the conï¬dence interval. As with all statistics, these two statistics cannot be based on the\\nvalue of the parameter. In addition, the formulas for these two statistics are determined in advance of having the actual\\ndata. The term conï¬dence can be related to the production of conï¬dence intervals. We can think of the situation in\\n\\n290\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nInterval Estimation\\n\\nFigure 16.5: One hundred conï¬dence build from repeatedly simulating 100 standard normal random variables and constructing 95% conï¬dence\\nintervals for the mean value - 0. Note that the 24th interval is entirely below 0 and so does not contain the actual parameter. The 11th, 80th and 91st\\nintervals are entirely above 0 and again do not contain the parameter.\\n\\nwhich we produce independent conï¬dence intervals repeatedly. Each time, we may either succeed or fail to include\\nthe true parameter in the conï¬dence interval. In other words, the inclusion of the parameter value in the conï¬dence\\ninterval is a Bernoulli trial with success probability Î³.\\n\\nFor example, after having seen these 100 intervals in Figure 5, we can conclude that the lowest and highest intervals\\nare much less likely than 95% of containing the true parameter value. This phenomena can be seen in the presidential\\npolls for the 2012 election. Three days before the election we see the following spread between Mr. Obama and Mr.\\nRomney\\n\\n0% -1% 0% 1% 5% 0% -5% -1% 1% 1%\\n\\nwith the 95% conï¬dence interval having a margin of error â¼ 3% based on a sample of size â¼ 1000. Because these\\nvalues are highly dependent, the values of Â±5% is less likely to contain the true spread.\\nExercise 16.16. Perform the computations needed to determine the margin of error in the example above.\\n\\nThe following example, although never likely to be used in an actual problem, may shed some insight into the\\n\\ndifference between conï¬dence and probability.\\n\\n291\\n\\n0102030405060708090100â0.5â0.4â0.3â0.2â0.100.10.20.30.40.5\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nInterval Estimation\\n\\nExample 16.17. Let X1 and X2 be two independent observations from a uniform distribution on the interval [Î¸ â\\n1, Î¸ + 1] where Î¸ is an unknown parameter. In this case, an observation is greater than Î¸ with probability 1/2, and less\\nthan Î¸ with probability 1/2. Thus,\\n\\nâ¢ with probability 1/4, both observations are above Î¸,\\nâ¢ with probability 1/4, both observations are below Î¸, and\\nâ¢ with probability 1/2, one observation is below Î¸ and the other is above.\\n\\nIn the third case alone, the conï¬dence interval contains the parameter value. As a consequence of these considerations,\\nthe interval\\n\\n(ËÎ¸(cid:96)(X1, X2), ËÎ¸u(X1, X2)) = (min{X1, X2}, max{X1, X2})\\n\\nis a 50% conï¬dence interval for the parameter.\\n\\nSometimes, max{X1, X2} â min{X1, X2} > 1. Because any subinterval of the interval [Î¸ â 1, Î¸ + 1] that has\\nlength at least 1 must contain Î¸, the midpoint of the interval, this conï¬dence interval must contain the parameter value.\\nIn other words, sometimes the 50% conï¬dence interval is certain to contain the parameter.\\n\\nExercise 16.18.

The notion behind\\nbootstrap techniques begins with the concession that the information about the source of the data is insufï¬cient to\\nperform the analysis to produce the necessary description of the distribution of the estimator. This is particularly true\\nfor small data sets or highly skewed data.\\n\\nThe strategy is to take the data and treat it as if it were the distribution underlaying the data and to use a resampling\\nprotocol to describe the estimator. For the example above, we estimated the angle in a right triangle by estimating (cid:96)\\n\\n294\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nInterval Estimation\\n\\nFigure 16.6: Bootstrap distribution of ËÎ¸.\\n\\nand h, the lengths two adjacent sides by taking the mean of our measurements and then computing the arctangent of\\nthe ratio of these means.

We take the data\\n\\nx1, x2, . . . , xn1,\\n\\ny1, y2, . . . , yn2,\\n\\nthe empirical distribution of the measurements of (cid:96) and h and act as if it were the actual distribution. The next step\\nis the use the data and randomly create the results of the experiment many times over.

At the present\\ntime, the problem appears entirely trivial and within reach of a beginning undergraduate. But, with a\\ndegree of embarrassment, I must confess that it took something like half a decade of combined effort of\\nE.S.P. and myself to put things straight. - Jerzy Neymann in the Festschrift in honor of Herman Wold,\\n1970, E.S.P is Egon Sharpe Pearson\\n\\n17.1 Overview and Terminology\\nStatistical hypothesis testing is designed to address the question: Do the data provide sufï¬cient evidence to conclude\\nthat we must depart from our original assumption concerning the state of nature?\\n\\nThe logic of hypothesis testing is similar to the one a juror faces in a criminal trial: Is the evidence provided by the\\nprosecutor sufï¬cient for the jury to depart from its original assumption that the defendant is not guilty of the charges\\nbrought before the court?\\n\\nTwo of the juryâs possible actions are\\nâ¢ Find the defendant guilty.\\nâ¢ Find the defendant not guilty.\\nThe weight of evidence that is necessary to ï¬nd the defendant guilty depends on the type of trial. In a criminal\\ntrial the stated standard is that the prosecution must prove that the defendant is guilty beyond any reasonable doubt.\\nIn civil trials, the burden of proof may be the intermediate level of clear and convincing evidence or the lower level of\\nthe preponderance of evidence.\\n\\nGiven the level of evidence needed, a prosecutors task is to present the evidence in the most powerful and convinc-\\n\\ning manner possible. We shall see these notions reï¬ected in the nature of hypothesis testing.\\n\\nThe simplest set-up for understanding the issues of statistical hypothesis, is the case of two values Î¸0, and Î¸1 in\\n\\nthe parameter space. We write the test, known as a simple hypothesis as\\n\\nH0 : Î¸ = Î¸0\\n\\nversus H1 : Î¸ = Î¸1.\\n\\nH0 is called the null hypothesis. H1 is called the alternative hypothesis.\\n\\nWe now frame the issue of hypothesis testing using the classical approach. In this approach, the possible actions\\n\\nare:\\n\\nâ¢ Reject the hypothesis. Rejecting the hypothesis when it is true is called a type I error or a false positive. Its\\nprobability Î± is called the size of the test or the signiï¬cance level. Sometimes, 1 â Î±, the true negatiive is\\n\\n303\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nSimple Hypotheses\\n\\ncalled the speciï¬city. In symbols, we write\\n\\nÎ± = PÎ¸0{reject H0}.\\n\\nâ¢ Fail to reject the hypothesis. Failing to reject the hypothesis when it is false is called a type II error or a false\\nnegative, has probability Î². The power of the test, 1 â Î², the probability of rejecting the test when it is indeed\\nfalse, is also called the true positive fraction or the the sensitivity. In symbols, we write\\n\\nÎ² = PÎ¸1{fail to reject H0}\\nhypothesis tests\\n\\nand\\n\\n1 â Î² = PÎ¸1{reject H0}.\\ncriminal trials\\n\\nH0 is true\\ntype I error\\n\\nH1 is true\\n\\nOK\\n\\nconvict\\n\\ninnocent\\n\\nthe defendant is\\nguilty\\nOK\\n\\nOK\\n\\ntype II error\\n\\ndo not convict\\n\\nOK\\n\\nreject H0\\n\\nfail to reject H0\\n\\nThus, the higher level necessary to secure conviction in a criminal trial corresponds to having lower signiï¬cance\\nlevels. This analogy should not be taken too far. The nature of the data and the decision making process is quite\\ndissimilar. For example, the prosecutor and the defense attorney are not always out to ï¬nd the most honest manner\\nto present information. In statistical inference for hypothesis testing, the goal is something that all participants in this\\nendeavor ought to share.\\n\\nIn addition, care should be taken not to be overly invested in a ï¬xed value Î± for the signiï¬cance level. As we con-\\ntinue to investigate the logic and methodology behind hypothesis testing, we will broaden and make more sophisticated\\nour approach to evaluating hypotheses.\\n\\nThe decision for the test is often based on ï¬rst determining a critical region C. Data x in this region is determined\\n\\nto be too unlikely to have occurred when the null hypothesis is true. Thus, the decision is\\n\\nGiven a choice Î± for the size of the test, the choice of a critical region C is called best or most powerful if for any\\n\\nother choice of critical region Câ for a size Î± test, i.e., both critical region lead to the same type I error probability,\\n\\nreject H0\\n\\nif and only if x â C.\\n\\nbut perhaps different type II error probabiities\\n\\nÎ± = PÎ¸0{X â C} = PÎ¸0{X â C\\n\\nâ\\n\\n},\\n\\nÎ² = PÎ¸1{X /â C},\\n\\n= PÎ¸1{X /â C\\n\\n},\\n\\nâ\\n\\nÎ²\\n\\nâ\\n\\nwe have the lowest probability of a type II error, (Î² â¤ Î²â) associated to the critical region C.\\nThe two approaches to hypothesis testing, classical and Bayesian, begin with distinct starting points and end with\\ndifferent interpretations for implications of the data. Interestingly, both approaches result in a decision that is based on\\nthe values of a likelihood ratio. In the classical approach, we shall learn, based on the Neyman-Pearson lemma, that\\nthe decision is based on a level for this ratio based on setting the type I error probabilities. In the Bayesian approach,\\nthe decision on minimizing risk, a concept that we will soon deï¬ne precisely.\\n\\n17.2 The Neyman-Pearson Lemma\\nMany critical regions are either determined by the consequences of the Neyman-Pearson lemma or by using analogies\\nof this fundamental lemma. Rather than presenting a proof of this lemma, we will provide some intuition for the choice\\nof critical region through the following âgameâ.\\n\\nWe will conduct a single observation X that can take values from â11 to 11 and based on that observation, decide\\nwhether or not to reject the null hypothesis. Basing a decision on a single observation, of course, is not the usual\\n\\n304\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nSimple Hypotheses\\n\\ncircumstance for hypothesis testing. We will ï¬rst continue on this line of reasoning to articulate the logic behind the\\nNeyman-Pearson lemma before examining more typical and reasonable data collection protocols.\\n\\nTo begin the game, corresponding to values for x running from â11 to 11, write a row of the number from 0 up\\nto 10 and back down to 0 and add an additional 0 at each end. These numbers add to give 100. Now, scramble the\\nnumbers and write them under the ï¬rst row. This can be created and displayed quickly in R using the commands:\\n\\n> x<- -11:11\\n> L1<-c(0,0:10,9:0,0)\\n> L0<-sample(L0) #This provides a random perturbation of the values in L1.\\n> data.frame(x,L1,L0)\\n\\nThe top row, giving the values of L1, represents the likelihood for one observation under the alternative hypothesis.\\nThe bottom row, giving the values of L0, represents the likelihood under the null hypothesis. Note that the values for\\nL0 is a rearrangement of the values for L1. Here is the output.\\n\\nx\\n\\nL1(x)\\nL0(x)\\n\\n-11\\n0\\n3\\n\\n-10\\n0\\n8\\n\\n-9\\n1\\n7\\n\\n-8\\n2\\n5\\n\\n-7\\n3\\n7\\n\\n-6\\n4\\n1\\n\\n-5\\n5\\n3\\n\\n-4\\n6\\n10\\n\\n-3\\n7\\n6\\n\\n-2\\n8\\n0\\n\\n-1\\n9\\n6\\n\\n0\\n10\\n4\\n\\n1\\n9\\n2\\n\\n2\\n8\\n5\\n\\n3\\n7\\n0\\n\\n4\\n6\\n1\\n\\n5\\n5\\n0\\n\\n6\\n4\\n4\\n\\n7\\n3\\n0\\n\\n8\\n2\\n8\\n\\n9\\n1\\n2\\n\\n10\\n0\\n9\\n\\n11\\n0\\n9\\n\\nThe goal is to pick values x so that the accumulated points (the beneï¬t) increase as quickly as possible from the\\nlikelihood L1 keeping points (the cost) from L0 as low as possible. The natural start is to pick values of x so that\\nL0(x) = 0. Then, the beneï¬t begins to add up without any cost. We ï¬nd four such values for x and record their values\\nalong with running totals for L1 and L0.\\n\\nx\\n\\nL1 total\\nL0 total\\n\\n-2\\n8\\n0\\n\\n3\\n15\\n0\\n\\n5\\n20\\n0\\n\\n7\\n23\\n0\\n\\nBeing ahead by a score of 23 to 0 can be translated into a best critical region C in the following way. If we take\\n\\nC = {â2, 3, 5, 7}, then, because the L1-total is 23 points out of a possible 100, we ï¬nd the power of the test\\n\\nand the type II error Î² = P1{X /â C} = 0.77. Because the L0-total is 0 points, the size of the test,\\n\\n1 â Î² = P1{X â C} = 0.23\\n\\nand there is no chance of type I error with this critical region.\\nUnderstanding the next choice is crucial. Candidates are\\n\\nÎ± = P0{X â C} = 0\\n\\nx = 4, with L1(4) = 6 against L0(4) = 1 and x = 1, with L1(1) = 9 against L0(1) = 2.\\n\\nThe choice 6 against 1 is better than 9 against 2. One way to see this is to note that choosing 6 against 1 twice will\\nput us in a better place than the single choice of 9 against 2. Indeed, after choosing 6 against 1, a choice of 3 against\\n1 puts us in at least as good a position than the single choice of 9 against 2. The central point is that the best choice\\ncomes to picking the remaining value for x that has the highest beneï¬t-to-cost ratio of L1(x) to L0(x)\\n\\nNow we can pick the next few candidates, keeping track of both the type I and type II error of the test with the\\n\\nchoice of critical region being the chosen values of x.\\n\\nx\\n\\n-2\\n\\n3\\nL1(x)/L0(x) â â\\n15\\n0\\n\\nL1 total\\nL0 total\\n\\n8\\n0\\n\\nÎ²\\nÎ±\\n\\n0.92\\n0.00\\n\\n0.85\\n0.00\\n\\n5\\n7\\nâ â\\n23\\n20\\n0\\n0\\n0.77\\n0.00\\n\\n0.80\\n0.00\\n\\n4\\n6\\n29\\n1\\n\\n0.71\\n0.01\\n\\n1\\n9/2\\n38\\n3\\n\\n0.62\\n0.03\\n\\n-6\\n4\\n42\\n4\\n\\n0.58\\n0.04\\n\\n0\\n5/2\\n52\\n8\\n\\n0.48\\n0.08\\n\\n-5\\n5/3\\n57\\n11\\n0.43\\n0.11\\n\\n305\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nSimple Hypotheses\\n\\nFigure 17.1: Receiver Operating Characteristic.

The vertical axis\\n1 â Î² is also called the true positive fraction (TPF).\\n\\nFrom this exercise we see how the likelihood ratio test is the choice for a most powerful test.

In genuine examples, we will typically\\nlook for type II error probability much below 0.43 and we will make many observations. We now summarize carefully\\nthe insights from this game before examining more genuine examples. A proof of this theorem is provided in Section\\n17.4.\\n\\nTheorem 17.1 (Neyman-Pearson Lemma). Let L(Î¸|x) denote the likelihood function for the random variable X\\ncorresponding to the probability PÎ¸.

These critical values are related to the critical value kÎ± in extensions of the ideas of likelihood ratios.

For example, by the mere fact that the\\ngraph is increasing, we can see that by setting a more rigorous test achieved by lowering Î±, the level of signiï¬cance,\\n(decreasing the value on the horizontal axis) necessarily reduces 1â Î², the power (decreasing the value on the vertical\\naxis.). The unusual and slightly mystifying name is due to the fact that the ROC was ï¬rst developed during World\\nWar II for detecting enemy objects in battleï¬elds, Following the surprise military attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the\\nUnited States saw the need to improve the prediction of the movement of aircraft from their radar signals.\\n\\nExercise 17.2. Consider the following (ignorant) example. Flip a coin that gives heads with probability Î±. Ignore\\nwhatever data you have collected and reject if the coin turns up heads. This test has signiï¬cance level Î±. Show that\\nthe receiver operating characteristic curve is the line through the origin having slope 1.\\n\\nThis shows what a minimum acceptable ROC curve looks like - any\\nhypothesis test ought be better than a coin toss that ignores the data. The\\nROC can be used as a test diagnostic. One commonly used is the area\\nunder the ROC, (AUC). For the example above, the AUC is 1/2. So any\\ntest should be improve on that value. The ânearly perfect testâ would have\\nhave the power near to 1 for even very low signiï¬cance level. In this case\\nthe AUC is very nearly equal to 1.\\n\\n17.3 Examples\\nExample 17.3. Mimicry is the similarity of one species to another in a\\nmanner that enhances the survivability of one or both species - the model\\nand mimic . This similarity can be, for example, in appearance, behavior,\\nsound, or scent. One method for producing a mimic species is hybridiza-\\ntion. This results in the transferring of adaptations from the model species\\nto the mimic. The genetic signature of this has recently been discovered in\\nHeliconius butterï¬ies. Padro-Diaz et al sequenced chromosomal regions\\nboth linked and unlinked to the red color locus and found a region that displays an almost perfect genotype by pheno-\\ntype association across four species in the genus Heliconius\\n\\nFigure 17.2: Heliconius butterï¬ies\\n\\nLetâs consider a model butterï¬y species with mean wingspan Âµ0 = 10 cm and a mimic species with mean wingspan\\nÂµ1 = 7 cm. For both species, the wingspans have standard deviation Ï0 = 3 cm. Collect 16 specimen to decide if the\\nmimic species has migrated into a given region. If we assume, for the null hypothesis, that the habitat under study is\\npopulated by the model species, then\\n\\nâ¢ a type I error is falsely concluding that the species is the mimic when indeed the model species is resident and\\nâ¢ a type II error is falsely concluding that the species is the model when indeed the mimic species has invaded.\\n\\nIf our action is to begin an eradication program if the mimic has invaded, then a type I error would result in the\\neradication of the resident model species and a type II error would result in the letting the invasion by the mimic take\\nits course.\\n\\n307\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nSimple Hypotheses\\n\\nTo begin, we set a signiï¬cance level. The choice of an Î± = 0.05 test means that we are accepting a 5% chance of\\nhaving this error. If the goal is to design a test that has the lowest type II error probability, then the Neyman-Pearson\\nlemma tells us that the critical region is determined by a threshold level kÎ± for the likelihood ratio.\\n\\nWe next move to see how this critical region is determined.\\n\\nC =(cid:26)x;\\n\\nL(Âµ1|x)\\n\\nL(Âµ0|x) â¥ kÎ±(cid:27) .\\n\\nExample 17.4.

As we move the alternative value Âµ1 downward, the density of\\nÂ¯X moves leftward. The values for Âµ1 = 9, 8, and 7 are displayed on the left in Figure 17.4. This shift in the values is\\na way of saying that the alternative is becoming more and more distinct as Âµ1 decreases. The mimic species becomes\\neasier and easier to detect. We express this by showing that the test is more and more powerful with decreasing values\\nof Âµ1. This is displayed by the increasing area under the density curve to the left of the dashed line from 0.377 for\\nthe alternative Âµ1 = 9 to 0.9907 for Âµ1 = 7.

Although this is easy to state, the choice of a prior ought to be grounded in solid\\nscientiï¬c reasoning.\\nAs before, we collect data and with it compute the posterior probabilities of the two parameter values Î¸0 and Î¸1.\\n\\nThis gives us the posterior probabilities that H0 is true and H1 is true.\\n\\nWe can see, in its formulation, the wide difference in perspective between the Bayesian and classical approaches.\\nâ¢ In the Bayesian approach, we begin with a prior probability that H0 is true.\\n\\nIn the classical approach, the\\n\\nassumption is that H0 is true.\\n\\nâ¢ In the Bayesian approach, we use the data and Bayes formula to compute the posterior probability that H1 is\\ntrue. In the classical approach, we use the data and a signiï¬cance level to make a decision to reject H0. The\\nquestion: What is the probability that H1 is true? has no meaning in the classical setting.\\n\\nâ¢ The decision to reject H0 in the Bayesian setting is based on minimizing risk using presumed losses for type\\nI and type II errors. In classical statistics, the choice of type I error probability is used to construct a critical\\nregion. This choice is made with a view to making the type II error probability as small as possible. We reject\\nH0 whenever the data fall in the critical region.\\n\\nBoth approaches use as a basic concept, the likelihood function L(Î¸|x) for the data x. Let ËÎ be a random variable\\n\\ntaking on one of the two values Î¸0, Î¸1 and having a distribution equal to the prior probability Ï. Thus,\\n\\nRecall Bayes formula for events A and C,\\n\\nÏ{Î¸i} = P{ ËÎ = Î¸i},\\n\\ni = 0, 1.\\n\\nP (C|A) =\\n\\nP (A|C)P (C)\\n\\nP (A|C)P (C) + P (A|C c)P (C c)\\n\\n,\\n\\n(17.13)\\n\\nwe set C to be the event that the alternative hypothesis is true and A to be the event that the data take on the value x.\\nIn symbols,\\n\\nFocus for the moment on the case in which the data are discrete, we have the conditional probabilities for the alternative\\nhypothesis.\\n\\nC = { ËÎ = Î¸1} = {H1 is true}\\n\\nand A = {X = x}.\\n\\nSimilarly, for the null hypothesis,\\n\\nP (A|C) = PÎ¸1{X = x} = fX (x|Î¸1) = L(Î¸1|x).\\n\\nP (A|C c) = PÎ¸0{X = x} = fX (x|Î¸0) = L(Î¸0|x).\\nThe posterior probability that H1 is true can be written symbolically in several ways.\\n\\nReturning to Bayes formula, we make the substitutions in (17.13),\\n\\nf ËÎ|X (Î¸1|x) = P{H1 is true|X = x} = P{ ËÎ = Î¸1|X = x}\\n\\nf ËÎ|X (Î¸1|x) =\\n\\nL(Î¸1|x)Ï{Î¸1}\\n\\nL(Î¸0|x)Ï{Î¸0} + L(Î¸1|x)Ï{Î¸1}\\n\\n.\\n\\n316\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nSimple Hypotheses\\n\\nBy making a similar argument involving limits, we can reach the same identity for the density of continuous\\nrandom variables. The formula for the posterior probability can be more easily understood if we rewrite the expression\\nabove in terms of odds, i. e., as the ratio of probabilities.\\n\\nf ËÎ|X (Î¸1|x)\\nf ËÎ|X (Î¸0|x)\\n\\n=\\n\\nP{H1 is true|X = x}\\nP{H0 is true|X = x}\\n\\n=\\n\\nP{ ËÎ = Î¸1|X = x}\\nP{ ËÎ = Î¸0|X = x}\\n\\n=\\n\\nL(Î¸1|x)\\nL(Î¸0|x) Â·\\n\\nÏ{Î¸1}\\nÏ{Î¸0}\\n\\n.\\n\\n(17.14)\\n\\nWith this expression we see that the posterior odds are equal to the likelihood ratio times the prior odds.

In general, pay particular attention to the choice\\nof numerator and denominator in this ratio.)\\n\\nThe decision whether or not to reject H0 depends on the values assigned for the loss obtained in making an\\nincorrect conclusion. We begin by setting values for the loss. This can be a serious exercise in which a group of\\nexperts weighs the evidence for either adverse outcome. We will take a loss of 0 for making a correct decision, a loss\\nof (cid:96)I for a type I error and (cid:96)II for a type II error.

However, the rationale, thus the value\\nfor the ratio necessary to reject, is quite different. For example, the higher the value of the prior odds, the higher the\\nlikelihood ratio needed to reject H0 under the Bayesian framework.\\nExample 17.16.

This could be anticipated. In reducing the signiï¬cance\\nlevel from Î± = 0.05 to Î± = 0.01, we make the criterion for rejecting more stringent by reducing he critical region C.\\nThe effect can be seen in FIgure 17.4. On the left side ï¬gure, the vertical dashed line is moved left to reduce the area\\nunder the black curve to the left of the dashed line. This, in turn, reduces the area under the other curves to the left of\\nthe dashed line. On the right ï¬gure, the vertical dashed line is moved left to the value Î± = 0.01 and, because the ROC\\ncurve is increasing, the values for the power decreased.\\n17.12.

For p0 > p1, the logarithm is negative\\n\\nlogarithm is positive. Thus, we isolate the sum(cid:80)n\\n\\nand the direction of the inequality in (17.8) is reversed.\\n17.13.

In this case, the parameter space Î is divided into two disjoint\\nregions, Î0 and Î1. The hypothesis test is now written\\n\\nversus H1 : Î¸ â Î1.\\nAgain, H0 is called the null hypothesis and H1 the alternative hypothesis.\\n\\nH0 : Î¸ â Î0\\n\\nFor the three alternatives to the question posed above, let Î¸ be one of the components in the parameter space, then\\nâ¢ increase would lead to the choices Î0 = {Î¸; Î¸ â¤ Î¸0} and Î1 = {Î¸; Î¸ > Î¸0},\\nâ¢ decrease would lead to the choices Î0 = {Î¸; Î¸ â¥ Î¸0} and Î1 = {Î¸; Î¸ < Î¸0}, and\\nâ¢ change would lead to the choices Î0 = {Î¸0} and Î1 = {Î¸; Î¸ (cid:54)= Î¸0}\\n\\nfor some choice of parameter value Î¸0.

Signiï¬cance level and power will necessitate\\nan extension of the ideas for simple hypotheses.\\n\\n18.2 The Power Function\\nPower is now a function of the parameter value Î¸. If our test is to reject H0 whenever the data fall in a critical region\\nC, then the power function is deï¬ned as\\n\\nthat gives the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis for a given value of the parameter.\\n\\nÏ(Î¸) = PÎ¸{X â C}.\\n\\n323\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nComposite Hypotheses\\n\\nThe ideal power function has\\n\\nÏ(Î¸) â 0 for all Î¸ â Î0 and Ï(Î¸) â 1 for all Î¸ â Î1\\n\\nWith this property for the power function, we would rarely reject the null hypothesis when it is true and rarely fail to\\nreject the null hypothesis when it is false.\\n\\nIn reality, incorrect decisions are made. Thus, for Î¸ â Î0,\\n\\nÏ(Î¸) is the probability of making a type I error,\\n\\ni.e., rejecting the null hypothesis when it is indeed true. For Î¸ â Î1,\\n\\n1 â Ï(Î¸) is the probability of making a type II error,\\n\\ni.e., failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false.\\n\\nThe goal is to make the chance for error small. The traditional method is analogous to that employed in the\\nNeyman-Pearson lemma. Fix a (signiï¬cance) level Î±, now deï¬ned to be the largest value of Ï(Î¸) in the region Î0\\ndeï¬ned by the null hypothesis. In other words, by focusing on the value of the parameter in Î0 that is most likely to\\nresult in an error, we insure that the probability of a type I error is no more that Î± irrespective of the value for Î¸ â Î0.\\nThen, we look for a critical region that makes the power function as large as possible for values of the parameter\\nÎ¸ â Î1\\n\\nFigure 18.1: Power function for the one-sided test with alternative âgreaterâ.

Also, ËÎ¸ increases with n and we can reduce the\\ncritical region while maintaining signiï¬cance if we increase the sample size.\\n\\nThe assessment of statistical power is an important aspect of experimental design. In practical terms, we can\\n\\nincrease power by either increasing effort or asking a less stringent question. For example, we can increase effort\\n\\nâ¢ (mathematics) by applying a more powerful test or a more rigorous design,\\nâ¢ (engineering) by designing a better measuring devise, reducing variance, or\\nâ¢ (exersion) by increasing sample size\\nWe can ask a less stringent question\\nâ¢ by increasing the signiï¬cance level and thus the ability to reject the null hypothesis or\\nâ¢ by increasing the difference between null value and the alternative value for detection of difference\\nThese practical considerations will be useful in understanding the change in power resulting from a change in the\\n\\nexperimental design and hypothesis testing.\\n\\n18.3 The p-value\\nThe report of reject the null hypothesis does not describe the strength of the evidence because it fails to give us the sense\\nof whether or not a small change in the values in the data could have resulted in a different decision. Consequently,\\none common method is not to choose, in advance, a signiï¬cance level Î± of the test and then report ârejectâ or âfail to\\nrejectâ, but rather to report the value of the test statistic and to give all the values for Î± that would lead to the rejection\\nof H0. The p-value is the probability of obtaining a result at least as extreme as the one that was actually observed,\\nassuming that the null hypothesis is true. In this way, we provide an assessment of the strength of evidence against\\nH0. Consequently, a very low p-value indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis.\\n\\nExample 18.8.

For the previous example, we could not have rejected H0 at the Î± = 0.05 signiï¬cance level. Indeed, we\\ncould not have rejected H0 at any level below the p-value, 0.0770786. On the other hand, we would reject H0 for any\\nsigniï¬cance level above this value.\\n\\nMany statistical software packages (including R, see the example below) do not need to have the signiï¬cance level\\nin order to perform a test procedure. This is especially important to note when setting up a hypothesis test for the\\npurpose of deciding whether or not to reject H0. In these circumstances, the signiï¬cance level of a test is a value that\\nshould be decided before the data are viewed. After the test is performed, a report of the p-value adds information\\nbeyond simply saying that the results were or were not signiï¬cant.\\n\\nIt is tempting to associate the p-value to a statement about the probability of the null or alternative hypothesis being\\ntrue. Such a statement would have to be based on knowing which value of the parameter is the true state of nature.\\nAssessing whether of not this parameter value is in Î0 is the reason for the testing procedure and the p-value was\\ncomputed in knowledge of the data and our choice of Î0.\\n\\nIn the example above, the test is based on having a test statistic S(x) (namely Â¯x) fall below a level kÎ±, i.e., we\\n\\nhave decision\\n\\nreject H0 if and only if S(x) â¤ kÎ±.\\n\\n332\\n\\n789101112130.00.10.20.30.40.50.6xdnorm(x, 10, 3/4)789101112130.00.10.20.30.40.50.6x789101112130.00.10.20.30.40.50.6x789101112130.00.10.20.30.40.50.6x\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nComposite Hypotheses\\n\\nThis choice of kÎ± is based on the choice of signiï¬cance level Î± and the choice of Î¸0 â Î0 so that Ï(Î¸0) = PÎ¸0{S(X) â¤\\nkÎ±} = Î±, the lowest value for the power function under the null hypothesis.

Is the hypothesis test above signiï¬cant at the 5% level? the 1% level?\\n\\nIn 2016, the American Statistical Association set for itself a task to make a statement on p-values. They note that\\nit is all too easy to set a test, create a test statistic and compute a p-value. Proper statistical practice is much more than\\nthis and includes\\n\\nâ¢ appropriately chosen techniques based on a thorough understanding of the phenomena under study,\\nâ¢ adequate visual and numerical summaries of the data,\\nâ¢ properly conducted analyses whose logic and quantitative approaches are clearly explained,\\nâ¢ correct interpretation of statistical results in context, and\\nâ¢ reproducibility of results via a thorough reporting.\\n\\nExpressing a p-value is one of many approaches to summarize the results of a statistical investigation. The notion\\nis that the smaller the p-value, the greater the statistical incompatibility of the data with the null hypothesis. This\\nincompatibility is meant to cast doubt on the null hypothesis.\\n\\nUnder the logic of classical statistics, the p-value cannot be turned into a statement about the truth of the null\\nhypothesis but rather is a statement about the data in relation to a speciï¬ed statistical model stated as a hypothesis\\ntest. Moreover, the p-value is not meant to serve as a âbright lineâ between true and false. Part of this arises from the\\npedogogy of introducing of hypothesis testing in setting a signiï¬cance level Î± as a part of the test.\\n\\nThese issues are compounded in most scientiï¬c considerations where multiple hypothesis testing makes interpre-\\ntation of p-values difï¬cult and calls on the authors for complete transparency of all statistical procedures including\\ndata collection and hypothesis testing. In addition, even strong statistical evidence of the incompatibility of the data\\nwith the null hypothesis may have very little practical or scientiï¬c meaning.\\n\\nMany investigators engage in statistical analysis based on limited background and so often need to collaborate to\\nï¬nd other appropriate statistical approached to decision making under uncertainty. Some appear in this book, e.g.,\\nBayes factors, likelihood ratios, and false discovery rates, but there are many others.\\n\\n333\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nComposite Hypotheses\\n\\n18.4 Distribution of p-values and the Receiving Operating Characteristic\\nLetâs return to the case of a simple hypotheses.\\n\\nH0 : Î¸ = Î¸0\\n\\nversus H1 : Î¸ = Î¸1.\\n\\nAs before, for data x, let S(x) be a test statistic for this hypothesis, rejecting if the value of test statistic S(x) is\\ntoo low. If S(x) = s, the p-value is FS(X)(s|Î¸0) = PÎ¸0{S(X) â¤ s}. Recalling out introductory example on model\\nand mimic butterï¬ies, the hypothesis on the mean wing span in centimeters, is\\n\\nH0 : Âµ = Âµ0\\n\\nversus H1 : Âµ = Âµ1.\\n\\nIn this situation, the test statistic S(X) = Â¯X is N (Âµ0, Ï/ân) under the null hypothesis.\\nIf the standard devia-\\ntion is sigma with n observations, using xbar to denote the sample mean, we ï¬nd the p-value with the command\\npnorm(xbar,mu0,sigma/sqrt(n)).\\n\\nFor a signiï¬cance test at level Î±, there exists a critical value kÎ± so that\\n\\nÎ± = PÎ¸0{S(X) â¤ kÎ±} = FS(X)(kÎ±|Î¸0)\\n\\nand we reject the null hypothesis at level Î± if the value of the test statistic is below the critical value, i. e., s < kÎ±. Thus,\\nfor signiï¬cance level alpha, we determine kÎ± with the command qnorm(alpha,mu0,sigma/sqrt(n)).\\n\\nFor the parameter value Î¸1, the power\\n\\n1 â Î²(Î±) = PÎ¸1{S(X) â¤ kÎ±}.\\n\\nIn other words, 1 â Î²(Î±) is the probability, under the alternative parameter Î¸1 that the p-value is less than Î±.\\nDeï¬ne FR(Î±) = 1 â Î²(Î±), then FR is a non-decreasing function on the interval [0, 1] with FR(0) = 0 and\\nFR(1) = 1. Thus, FR is a cumulative distribution function. Recall that the receiving operator characteristic is the\\nplot of the power as a function of signiï¬cance. In other words, it is the plot FR(Î±).\\nExercise 18.11. Show that the receiver operating characteristic gives the distribution function for the p-values for the\\nalternative parameter value Î¸1.\\n\\nThe area under the receiving operator characteristic, AUC,\\n\\n(cid:90) 1\\n\\n0\\n\\nFR(Î±) dÎ±.\\n\\nis a general diagnostic for the overall power of a test. If the AUC is nearly 1, then the power has the very desirable\\nproperty of increasing quickly for low signiï¬cance levels.\\nExercise 18.12. Let Si, i = 0, 1 be independent random variables that have the distributions of S(X) under Î¸i. The\\nthe area under the curve equals\\n\\n(cid:90) â\\n\\nââ\\n\\nF1(s0)f0(s0) ds0 = P{S1 < S0}.\\n\\n(18.5)\\n\\nIn words, for two independent samples of the test statistic, one under the null hypothesis and the other under the\\nalternative, the area under the curve is the probability that the value under the alternative is smaller. We will see a\\nsimilar expression in an alternative approach to t procedures. This will leads to the Wilcoxon ranked sum test and an\\ninterpretation associated to the area under the empirical receiving operator characteristic.\\nExercise 18.13.

Simulate P{S1 < S0} in the previous exercise and see how they match the values for the AUC.\\n\\n18.5 Multiple Hypothesis Testing\\nWe now consider testing multiple hypotheses. This is common in the world of âbig dataâ with thousands of hypothesis\\non many issues in subjects including genomics, internet searches, or ï¬nancial transactions. For m hypotheses, let\\np1, . . . , pm be the p-values for m hypothesis tests.\\n\\n18.5.1 Familywise Error Rate\\nThe familywise error rate (FWER) is the probability of making even one type I error. If we set Î±B for the signiï¬cance\\nlevel for a single test, then the simplest strategy is to employ the Bonferroni correction. This uses the Bonferroni\\ninequality,\\n\\nP (A1 âª Â·Â·Â· âª Am) â¤ P (A1) + Â·Â·Â· + P (Am)\\n\\nfor events A1, . . . , Am.\\n\\nIf Ai is the event of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true, then A1 âª Â·Â·Â· âª Am is the event that at least one\\nof the hypotheses is rejected when it is true. For each i, P (Ai) = Î±B and so Î± = P (A1 âª Â·Â·Â· âª Am) â¤ mÎ±B. Thus,\\nthe Bonferroni correction is to reject if\\n\\npi â¤\\n\\nÎ±\\nm\\n\\nfor all i.\\n\\nExercise 18.15. For m independent, Î±I level hypothesis tests, show that the familywise error Î± = 1 â (1 â Î±I )m.\\nThus, (1 â Î±)1/m = 1 â Î±I and Î±I = 1 â (1 â Î±)1/m is the level necessary to obtain an Î± familywise error rate.\\n\\nThis gives a cautionary take, if we take Î± = 0.05 and m = 20, then the probability of one or more false positive\\ntests, 1 â (1 â 0.05)20 â 0.64, is well above 1/2. The Bonferroni correction, Î±B = 0.05/20 = 0.0025 and the\\nindependence correction, Î±I = 1 â (1 â 0.05)1/20 = 0.0256 will guarantee a familywise error rate Î± = 0.05\\n\\nNote that the second method allows for slightly higher values of Î± than the Bonferroni correction. However, it is\\nfar less general. For independent test statistics, Fisherâs method for testing multiple works directly with the p-values.\\nWe begin with the following exercise.\\nExercise 18.16. Let Î¸0 be the true state of nature. Assume that the distribution function for the text statistic S(X) is\\ncontinuous and strictly increasing for all possible values. Show that the p-value is uniformly distributed on the interval\\n[0, 1].\\n\\nIn this circumstance, if the null hypothesis is true for all m hypotheses, then\\n\\np1, . . . , pm are independent U (0, 1) random variables.\\n\\nRecall from the use of the probability transform that\\n\\nâ2 ln p1, . . . ,â2 ln pm are independent Exp(1/2) random variables.\\n\\nSo their sum\\n\\nâ2 ln p1 â Â·Â·Â· â 2 ln pm is a Î(1/2, m) random variable.\\n\\nThus this Î random variable can serve as a test statistic for the multiple hypothesis that all the null hypotheses are\\ntrue, rejecting if the sum above is sufï¬ciency large. Traditionally, we use the fact that Î(1/2, m) is also a member of\\n2m and then use this as the distribution of â2 ln p1 â Â·Â·Â· â 2 ln pm under the multiple\\nthe chi-square family, namely, Ï2\\nhypothesis that all m null hypotheses hold.\\n\\n335\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nComposite Hypotheses\\n\\nExample 18.17.

A more\\nrelaxed and often more valuable criterion is the false discovery rate..\\n\\nThus, we can model question Is the null hypothesis hypothesis true? as a sequence of Bernoulli trials. Let Ï0 be the\\nsuccess parameter for the trials. Thus, with probability Ï0, the null hypothesis is true and the p-values follow FU , the\\nuniform distribution on the interval [0, 1].

We noticed, in the case of a simple hypothesis test\\nÏ2\\n\\nH0 : Âµ = Âµ0\\n\\nversus H1 : Âµ = Âµ1\\n\\nthat the critical region as determined by the Neyman-Pearson lemma depended only on whether or not Âµ1 was greater\\nthan Âµ0. For example, if Âµ1 > Âµ0, then the critical region C = {x; Â¯x â¥ ËkÎ±} shows that we reject H0 whenever the\\nsample mean is higher than some threshold value ËkÎ± irrespective of the difference between Âµ0 and Âµ1. An analogous\\nsituation occurs in the case that Âµ1 < Âµ0\\n\\nWe will examine the idea that if a test is most powerful against each possible alternative in a simple hypothesis\\ntest, when we can say that this test is in some sense best overall for a composite hypothesis. Stated in terms of the\\n\\n341\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nExtensions on the Likelihood Ratio\\n\\npower function, we are asking if a test has the property that its power function Ï is greater for every value of Î¸ â Î1\\nthan the power function of any other test. Such a test is called uniformly most powerful. In general, a hypothesis\\nwill not have a uniformly most powerful test. However, we can hope for such a test for procedures involving simple\\nhypotheses in which the test statistic that emerged from the likelihood test did not depend on the speciï¬c value of\\nthe alternative. This was seen in the example above using independent normal data. In this case, the power function\\nÏ(Âµ) = PÂµ{ Â¯X â¥ kÎ±} increases as Âµ increases and so the test has the intuitive property of becoming more powerful\\nwith increasing Âµ.\\n\\nIn general, we look for a test statistic T (x) (like Â¯x in the example above). Next, we check that the likelihood ratio,\\n\\nL(Î¸2|x)\\nL(Î¸1|x)\\n\\n,\\n\\nÎ¸1 < Î¸2.\\n\\n(19.1)\\n\\ndepends on the data x only through the value of statistic T (x) and, in addition, this ratio is a monotone increasing\\nfunction of T (x). The Karlin-Rubin theorem states:\\n\\nIf these conditions hold, then for an appropriate value of ËkÎ±, C = {x; T (x) â¥ ËkÎ±} is the critical region for a\\n\\nuniformly most powerful Î± level test for the one-sided alternative hypothesis\\n\\nA corresponding criterion holds for the one sided test with the inequalities reversed:\\n\\nH0 : Î¸ â¤ Î¸0\\n\\nversus H1 : Î¸ > Î¸0.\\n\\nExercise 19.1 (mark and recapture).

Thus Ëp = 0.7875 and z = 1.979.\\n\\nIf the\\nsigniï¬cance level is Î± = 0.05, then we will reject H0 because z = 1.979 > 1.645 = zÎ±.

If the p-value is below Î±, then we reject H0 and R returns true.\\n\\n> x<-16:10\\n> pvalue<- round(pbinom(x,26,0.7),4)\\n> data.frame(x,pvalue,pvalue<0.10,pvalue<0.05,pvalue<0.01)\\n\\nx pvalue pvalue...0.1 pvalue...0.05 pvalue...0.01\\nFALSE\\nFALSE\\nFALSE\\nFALSE\\nTRUE\\nTRUE\\nTRUE\\n\\n1 16 0.2295\\n2 15 0.1253\\n3 14 0.0603\\n4 13 0.0255\\n5 12 0.0094\\n6 11 0.0030\\n7 10 0.0009\\n\\nFALSE\\nFALSE\\nFALSE\\nTRUE\\nTRUE\\nTRUE\\nTRUE\\n\\nFALSE\\nFALSE\\nTRUE\\nTRUE\\nTRUE\\nTRUE\\nTRUE\\n\\nThus, we reject H0 when Î± = 0.10 for 14 or fewer surviving hives, Î± = 0.05 for 13 or fewer surviving hives, and\\nÎ± = 0.01 for 12 or fewer surviving hives. Thus, as Î± decreases, the null hypothesis needs more evidence to reject and\\nthe critical region becomes smaller.\\n\\nExercise 19.8. Use the R command qbinom to compute the critical value for an Î± = 0.10, 0.05, 0.01 test. Does it\\nmatch the results in the example above.\\n\\n19.2 Likelihood Ratio Tests\\nThe likelihood ratio test is a popular choice for composite hypothesis when Î0 is a subspace of the whole parameter\\nspace. The rationale for this approach is that the null hypothesis is unlikely to be true if the maximum likelihood on\\nÎ0 is sufï¬ciently smaller that the likelihood maximized over Î, the entire parameter space. In symbols, let ËÎ¸0 be the\\nparameter value that maximizes the likelihood for Î¸ â Î0 and ËÎ¸ be the parameter value that maximizes the likelihood\\nfor Î¸ â Î. Then the likelihood ratio\\n\\n(19.3)\\n\\nÎ(x) =\\n\\nL(ËÎ¸0|x)\\nL(ËÎ¸|x)\\n\\n.\\n\\nNote that this ratio is the reciprocal from the version given by the Neyman-Pearson lemma. Thus, the critical region\\nconsists of those values that are below a critical value.\\n\\nThe critical region for an Î±-level likelihood ratio test is\\n\\n{Î(x) â¤ Î»Î±}\\n\\n(19.4)\\n\\nAs with any Î± level test, Î»Î± is chosen so that\\n\\nPÎ¸{Î(X) â¤ Î»Î±} â¤ Î± for all Î¸ â Î0.\\n\\nThis in the end may result in a procedure that many take several steps to develop. First, we must determine the\\nlikelihood L(Î¸|x) for the parameter Î¸ based on the data x. We have two optimization problems - maximize L(Î¸|x)\\non the parameter space Î and on the null hypothesis space Î0. We evaluate the likelihood at these values and form\\nthe ratio. This generally give us a complex test statistic which we then simplify. We show this in some detail for a\\ntwo-sided test for the mean based on normal data.\\n\\n345\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nExtensions on the Likelihood Ratio\\n\\nExample 19.9.

The parameter\\nspace Î is one dimensional giving the value Âµ for the mean. As we have seen before ËÂµ = Â¯x. Î0 is the single point\\n{Âµ0} and so ËÂµ0 = Âµ0.

Thus, Î0 is d â k-dimensional.\\nTheorem 19.16. Whenever the maximum likelihood estimator has an asymptotically normal distribution, let Î(x) be\\nthe likelihood ratio (19.3) for an d-dimensional parameter space:\\n\\nH0 : Î¸i = ci for all i = 1, . . . , k versus H1 : Î¸1 (cid:54)= c1 for some i = 1, . . . , k\\n\\n348\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nExtensions on the Likelihood Ratio\\n\\nFigure 19.2: Thomas Morganâs 1916 drawings of a (left) single and (right) double crossing over event.

Thus,\\n\\ndegrees of freedom = dim(Î) â dim(Î0).\\n\\nTypically we can ascertain the degrees of freedom by counting free parameters in both Î and Î0 and subtracting.\\nExercise 19.17. Use a second order Taylor series for ln L(Î¸|x) and the asymptotic normality of maximum likelihood\\nestimators to outline the argument for the case d = k = 1,\\n\\nThe basic approach taken for this case extends to the general case. If we expand ln L(c|x) in a Taylor series about\\nthe parameters Î¸1 = ËÎ¸1, Î¸2 = ËÎ¸2,Â·Â·Â· , Î¸k = ËÎ¸k the maximum likelihood estimators, then the ï¬rst order terms in the\\nexpansion of ln L(c|x) vanish. The second order derivatives are the entries of the Fisher information matrix evaluated\\nat the maximum likelihood estimator. These terms converge by the law of large numbers.

For a one-side test with alternative H1 : p > p0, the p-value\\nis the area under the standard normal density above the z-score of the\\ndata. For the two-sided test, the p-value is the area under the standard\\nnormal density farther from zero than the z-score of the data. This\\nis the sum of the area under the curve above this z-score and the area\\nunder the curve below the negative of the z-score. Because the standard\\nnormal density is symmetric about 0, these two areas are equal. FIgure\\n19.2 demonstrates the p-value as the area of the two regions under the\\ndensity curves outside the black vertical lines.\\n\\nThe test is signiï¬cant at the 10% level because the p-value is be-\\nlow 0.10. Correspondingly, the test is not signiï¬cant at the 5% level\\nbecause the p-value is above 0.05.

Because we approximate Ï with s, the t-statistic has a higher level of uncertainty than the\\ncorresponding z-statistic. This uncertainty decreases with n, the number of observations. Thus, when using the t\\ndistribution to construct a conï¬dence interval for the population mean Âµ, we saw that the margin of error decreased\\nas the number of observations increased. Typically, we do not use the number of observations n to describe this but\\nrather degrees of freedom n â 1 to match the division by n â 1 in the computation of the sample variance, s2.\\nWe now turn to using the t-statistic as a test statistic for hypothesis tests of the population mean. As with several\\nother procedures we have seen, the two-sided t test is a likelihood ratio test. We will save showing this result into the\\nlast section and instead focus on the applications of this widely used set of procedures.\\n\\n20.1 Guidelines for Using the t Procedures\\n\\nâ¢ Except in the case of small samples, the assumption that the data are a simple random sample from the population\\n\\nof interest is more important that the population distribution is normal.\\n\\nâ¢ For sample sizes less than 15, use t procedures if the data are close to normal.\\nâ¢ For sample sizes at least 15 use t procedures except in the presence of outliers or strong skewness.\\nâ¢ The t procedures can be used even for clearly skewed distributions when the sample size is large, typically over\\n\\n40 observations.\\n\\nThese criteria are designed to ensure that Â¯x is a sample from a nearly normal distribution. When these guidelines\\nfail to be satisï¬ed, then we can turn to alternatives that are not based on the central limit theorem, but rather use the\\nrankings of the data. These alternatives, the Mann-Whitney or Wilcoxon rank sum test and the Wilcoxon signed-ranked\\ntest, are discussed at the end of this topic.\\n\\n361\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nt Procedures\\n\\n20.2 One Sample t Tests\\nWe will later explain that the likelihood ratio test for the two sided hypothesis\\nversus H1 : Âµ (cid:54)= Âµ0,\\n\\nH0 : Âµ = Âµ0\\n\\nbased on independent normal observations X1. . . . , Xn with unknown mean Âµ and unknown variance Ï2 is a t-test.\\n\\nSo, compute the t statistic T (x) from the data x.

Radon is a radioactive, colorless, odorless, tasteless noble gas, occurring naturally as the decay\\nproduct of uranium. It is one of the densest substances that remains a gas under normal conditions.\\n\\nRadon is responsible for the majority of the public exposure to ionizing radiation and is the most variable from\\nlocation to location. Radon gas from natural sources can accumulate in buildings, especially in conï¬ned areas such as\\nattics, and basements. Epidemiological evidence shows a clear link between breathing high concentrations of radon\\nand incidence of lung cancer. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, radon is the second\\nmost frequent cause of lung cancer, after cigarette smoking, causing 21,000 lung cancer deaths per year in the United\\nStates.\\n\\nTo check the reliability of radon detector, a university placed 12 detectors in a chamber having 105 picocuries of\\n\\nradon.

In particular, the number of observations nX and nY in the two samples could be\\ndifferent.

Unlike the match pairs procedures, the test statistic (20.1) does not\\nwith s2\\nhave a t distribution under the null hypothesis. Indeed, the density and the distribution of this statistic are difï¬cult to\\ncompute.\\n\\nIn this circumstance, we now make what is commonly known in statistics as a conservative approximation. We\\nreplace the actual distribution of the t statistic in (20.1) with one which has slightly bigger tails. Thus, the computed\\np-value which are just integrals of the density function will be slightly larger. In this way, a conservative procedures is\\none that does not decrease the type I error probability.\\n\\nThis goal can be accomplished by approximating an ordinary Studentâs t distribution with the effective degrees of\\n\\nfreedom Î½ calculated using the Welch-Satterthwaite equation:\\n\\nÎ½ =\\n\\n(s2\\n\\nX /nX + s2\\n(s2\\nX /nX )2/(nX â 1) + (s2\\n\\nY /nY )2\\nY /nY )2/(nY â 1)\\n\\n.\\n\\n(20.2)\\n\\nAs we saw in our discussion on Interval Estimation, this also gives a Î³-level conï¬dence interval for the difference\\n\\nin the means Âµx and ÂµY .\\n\\nÂ¯x â Â¯y Â± t(1âÎ³)/2,Î½(cid:115) s2\\n\\nX\\nnX\\n\\n+\\n\\ns2\\nY\\nnY\\n\\n.\\n\\nWe also learned that the effective degrees of freedom are largest when the two sample variances are nearly equal. In\\nthis case the number of degrees of freedom is 2 fewer than the sum of the two sets of observations.\\n\\nExample 20.6.

What can be said about the p-value for a one-sided test?\\n\\nThe two-sample procedure assumes that the two sets of observations are independent and so it is not an appropriate\\nprocedure when the the observations are paired. Moreover, the two sample procedure is yields less powerful test when\\nthe two sets of observations are positively correlated.\\nExample 20.9. Previously we investigated the relationship of age of parents to the de novo mutations in the offspring\\nfor the 78 Icelandic trios. Now, we address the simpler question: are fathers older than mothers at the time of the\\nchildâs birth? State as a hypothesis, we have\\n\\nH0 : Âµf â¤ Âµm versus H1 : Âµf > Âµm.\\n\\nwhere Âµm is the mean age of Icelandic fathers at the time of birth and Âµm is the mean age of Icelandic mothers. We\\nanticipate that the two parentsâ ages are positively correlcate - older fathers with older mothers and younger fathers\\nwith younger mothers.\\n\\nThe appropriate matched-pair test has R commands.\\n\\n> t.test(father,mother,alternative=c(\"greater\"),paired=TRUE)\\n\\nPaired t-test\\n\\nfather and mother\\n\\ndata:\\nt = 6.6209, df = 77, p-value = 2.151e-09\\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means is greater than 0\\n95 percent confidence interval:\\n\\n1.838564\\n\\nInf\\n\\nsample estimates:\\nmean of the differences\\n2.456197\\n\\n371\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nt Procedures\\n\\nNotice that t = 6.6209.

A natural\\nquestion to ask at this point is How do we compare the mean of more that two groups? As we shall soon learn, this\\nleads us to a test procedure, analysis of variance, that is a generalization of the pooled two-sample procedure?\\n\\n20.6 Summary of Tests of Signiï¬cance\\nThe procedures we have used to perform hypothesis tests are based on some quantity Î¸ generally expressed as a value\\nin a parameter space Î. In setting the hypothesis, we partition the parameter space into two parts Î0 for the null\\nhypothesis, H0, and Î1 for the alternative, H1. Our strategy is to look for generalizations of the Neyman-Pearson\\nparadigm. For example, the Karlin-Rubin criterion provides a condition for one-sided tests that allows us to say the\\nwe have a uniformly most powerful test.\\n\\nFor two-sided tests, we look to the likelihood ratio approach. For this approach, we ï¬rst maximize the likelihood\\nL(Î¸|x) both over Î0 and over Î and then compute the ratio Î(x). If the data, x, lead to a ratio that is sufï¬ciently\\nsmall, then likelihood for all values of Î¸ â Î0 are less likely then some values in Î1. This leads us to reject the\\nnull hypothesis in favor of the alternative. If the number of observations is large, then we can approximate, under the\\nnull hypothesis, the distribution of the test-statistic â2 ln Î(x) with a Ï2 distribution. This leads to a critical region\\nC = {â2 ln Î(x) â¥ ËkÎ±} for an Î±-level test.\\nIn practice, much of our inference is for population proportions and the population means. In these cases, we often\\nreserve the test for those cases in which the central limit theorem applies and thus the estimates, the sample proportions\\nand the sample means, have approximately a normal distribution. We summarize these procedures below.\\n\\n20.6.1 General Guidelines\\n\\nâ¢ Hypotheses are stated in terms of a population parameter.\\nâ¢ The null hypothesis H0 is a statement that no effect is present.\\nâ¢ The alternative hypothesis H1 is a statement that a parameter differs from its null value in a speciï¬c direction\\n\\n(one-sided alternative) or in either direction (two-sided alternative).\\n\\nâ¢ A test statistic is designed to assess the strength of evidence against H0.\\nâ¢ If a decision must be made, specify the signiï¬cance level Î±.\\nâ¢ Assuming H0 is true, the p-value is the probability that the test statistic would take a value as extreme or more\\n\\nextreme than the value observed.\\n\\nâ¢ If the p-value is smaller than the signiï¬cance level Î±, then H0 is rejected and the data are said to be statistically\\n\\nsigniï¬cant at level Î±.\\n\\n373\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nt Procedures\\n\\n20.6.2 Test for Population Proportions\\nThe design is based on Bernoulli trials .

This procedure is considered valid is the sample is small (< 10%) compared to the total\\npopulation and both np0 and n(1 â p0) is at least 10.

We then compute the value of the test statistic for our data and make an assessment. For the t test,\\nthus assessment is based on the t distribution. This, in turn, relies on the ability to say that the distributions of sample\\nmeans are nearly normally distributed. This is typically assured upon appeal to the central limit theorem. In some\\ncircumstances, we then choose a signiï¬cance level Î± and then the decision to reject the null hypotheses is based on\\nrelating the test statistics to this critical value, rejecting if the test statistic is more extreme than this standard. In other\\ncircumstances, we compute the p-value and use that to indicate the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis.\\nWe then follow up by deciding to reject the null hypothesis if the p-value is below the signiï¬cance level Î±.\\n\\n20.9.1 Permutation Test\\nIn the example of a test for the value of added calcium in the diet to lower blood pressure, the boxplot showed an\\noutlier in the blood pressure of one individual in the group that received a calcium supplement. As a consequence, the\\nassumption that the central limit theorem holds for the distribution of the sample means is in doubt. These data have a\\ndifference in sample means:\\n\\n> (diffdata<-mean(calcium)-mean(placebo))\\n[1] 5.272727\\n\\nWhen the central limit theorem applies, we can assess this difference by dividing by the standard error of the sample\\nmeans and use the value of a t statistic with the appropriate number of degrees of freedom.\\n\\nPermutation tests present an alternative to ï¬nding the sampling distribution for any test statistic, here the differ-\\nence in sample means. The procedures begin by asking, If the null hypothesis is true, then what shufï¬es of the data\\nare consistent with this statement?\\n\\nIn this case, we can think of the null hypothesis as stating that all of the observations for blood pressure are actually\\nderived from a single group and thus the assignment of an individual to a group, either placebo or calcium, should\\nhave no effect on the outcome. For the two groups, sizes n1 and n2, we have\\n\\n(cid:18)n1 + n2\\nn1 (cid:19)\\n\\nways to divide the entire sample into two groups, retaining the sizes found in the observations that constitute our data.\\nEach of these choices provides an additional value for the difference, under the null hypothesis, of sample means.\\nThese can be used to create an empirical sampling distribution. This methodology is feasible if n1 and n2 are not too\\nlarge. For larger sample sizes, we can also use a resampling technique, similar to the bootstrap, to randomly create\\nthe two groups and compute the difference in the means of these randomly chosen resampled groups.\\n\\n> bp<-c(placebo,calcium)\\n> diff<-rep(0,10000)\\n> groups<-c(rep(1,length(calcium)),\\n\\nrep(2,length(placebo)))\\n\\n> for(i in 1:10000){groupperm<-sample(groups);\\n\\ndiff[i]<-mean(bp[groupperm==1]\\n-mean(bp[groupperm==2]))}\\n\\nBecause the alternative is greater than, the p-value (which will vary a bit\\nfrom one simulation to the next) is the fraction of the simulations greater than\\nwhat is found in the data.

If the seventh,\\neighth, and ninth values are equal. they are all given the rank (7+8+9)/3 = 8.\\n\\nWe now re-draw the above ï¬gure using all of the\\ndata with the goal of interpreting the graph as an em-\\npirical receiving operator characteristic. The test\\nstatistic associated to the graph would be to identify\\nthe mosquito genotype solely on its lifespan. Thus\\nwe will ï¬x a number of days d0.

This method tells us\\nthat at the maximum likelihood estimator (Ëp1, . . . , Ëpk), the gradient of ln L(p|n) is proportional to the gradient of the\\nconstraint s(p). To explain this brieï¬y, recall that the gradient of a function is a vector that is perpendicular to a level\\nset of that function. In this case,\\n\\nâËps(p)\\n\\nis perpendicular to the level set {p; s(p) = 1}.\\n\\nNow imagine walking along the set of parameter values of p given by the constraint s(p) = 1, keeping track of\\nthe values of the function ln L(p|n).

Then the hypothesis takes the form\\n\\nH0 : p1 = p2 = p3 = p4 =\\n\\n1\\n4\\n\\n,\\n\\nversus H1 : at least one pi is unequal to 1\\n4\\n\\n.\\n\\nTo test this hypothesis, public health ofï¬cials from King County, Washington, collect data on n = 322 cases,\\n\\nï¬nding\\n\\nn1 = 78, n2 = 71, n3 = 87, n4 = 86\\n\\n389\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nGoodness of Fit\\n\\nFigure 21.2: The heights of the bars for each category are the standardized residuals (21.9).

Thus, we ï¬nd more occurrences of SIDS in the fall and\\nwinter. Is this difference statistical signiï¬cant or are these difference better explained by chance ï¬uctuations?\\n\\nWe carry out the chi square test. In this case, each of the 4 categories is equally probable.

As we saw with Gregor Mendelâs pea experiments, the two-allele\\nHardy-Weinberg principle states that after two generations of random mating the genotypic frequencies can be repre-\\nsented by a binomial distribution. So, if a population is segregating for two alleles A1 and A2 at an autosomal locus\\nwith frequencies p1 and p2, then random mating would give a proportion\\n\\np11 = p2\\n\\n1 for the A1A1 genotype, p12 = 2p1p2 for the A1A2 genotype, and p22 = p2\\n\\n2 for the A2A2 genotype.\\n\\nThen, with both genes in the homozygous genotype and half the genes in the heterozygous genotype, we ï¬nd that\\n\\np1 = p11 +\\n\\n1\\n2\\n\\np12\\n\\np2 = p22 +\\n\\n1\\n2\\n\\np12.\\n\\n(21.11)\\n\\nOur parameter space Î = {(p11, p12, p22); p11 + p12 + p22 = 1} is 2 dimensional. Î0, the parameter space\\nfor the null hypothesis, are those values p1, p2 that satisfy (21.11). With the choice of p1, the value p2 is determined\\nbecause p1 + p2 = 1. Thus, dim(Î0) = 1. Consequently, the chi-square test statistic will have 2-1=1 degree of\\nfreedom. Another way to see this is the following.\\n\\nMcDonald et al. (1996) examined variation at the CVJ5 locus in the American oyster, Crassostrea virginica.

The black vertical bar indicates the value of the test statistic in\\nExample 21.3. The area 0.552 under the curve to the right of the vertical line is the p-value for this test. This is much to high to reject the null\\nhypothesis. The red vertical lines show the critical values for a test with signiï¬cance Î± = 0.05 (to the left) and Î± = 0.01 (to the right). Thus, the\\narea under the curve to the right of these vertical lines is 0.05 and 0.01, respectively. These values can be found using qchisq(1-Î±,3).

One\\ncriterion, the Cochran conditions requires no cell has count zero, and more than 80% of the cells have counts at least\\n5. If this does not hold, then Fisherâs exact test uses the hypergeometric distribution (or its generalization) directly\\nrather than normal approximation.\\nFor example, for the 2 Ã 2 table,\\n\\nB2\\n\\ntotal\\nB1\\nO11 O12 O1Â·\\nO21 O22 O2Â·\\nn\\n\\nA1\\nA2\\ntotal OÂ·1 OÂ·2\\n\\nThe idea behind Fisherâs exact test is to begin with an empty table:\\n\\nB1 B2\\n\\nA1\\nA2\\ntotal OÂ·1 OÂ·2\\n\\ntotal\\nO1Â·\\nO2Â·\\nn\\n\\nand a null hypothesis that uses equally likely outcomes to ï¬ll in the table. We will use as an analogy the model of\\nmark and recapture. Normally the goal is to ï¬nd n, the total population. In this case, we assume that this population\\nsize is known and will consider the case that the individuals in the two captures are independent. This is assumed in\\nthe mark and recapture protocol. Here we test this independence.\\n\\nIn this regard,\\nâ¢ A1 - an individual in the ï¬rst capture and thus tagged.\\nâ¢ A2 - an individual not in the ï¬rst capture and thus not tagged.\\nâ¢ B1 - an individual in the second capture.\\nâ¢ B2 - an individual not in the second capture\\nThen, from the point of view of the A classiï¬cation:\\n\\n395\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nGoodness of Fit\\n\\nâ¢ We have O1Â· from a population n with the A1 classiï¬cation (tagged individuals).

Next, we ï¬ll in the\\nvalues for the B classiï¬cation\\n\\nâ¢ From the OÂ·1 belonging to category B1 (individuals in the second capture), O11 also belong to A1 (have a tag).\\n\\nThis outcome can be accomplished in\\n\\nways.\\n\\n(cid:18)OÂ·1\\nO11(cid:19) =\\n\\nOÂ·1!\\n\\nO11!O21!\\n\\nâ¢ From the OÂ·2 belonging to category B2 (individuals not in the second capture), O12 also belong to A1 (have a\\n\\ntag).

Thus, if we had derived the hypergeometric\\n\\nformula from the point of view of the B classiï¬cation we would have obtained exactly the same formula (21.14).\\n\\nTo complete the exact test, we rely on statistical software to do the following:\\nâ¢ compute the hypergeometric probabilities over all possible choices for entries in the cells that result in the given\\n\\nmarginal values, and\\n\\nâ¢ rank these probabilities from most likely to least likely.\\nâ¢ Find the ranking of the actual data.\\nâ¢ For a one-sided test of too rare, the p-value is the sum of probabilities of the ranking lower than that of the data.\\nA similar procedure applies to provide the Fisher exact test for r Ã c tables.\\n\\nExample 21.13. As a test of the assumptions for mark and recapture. We examine a small population of 120 ï¬sh.

This could be violated, for example, if the tagged ï¬sh are not uniformly dispersed in the\\npond.\\n\\nTwenty-ï¬ve are tagged and returned to the pond.

In Table II is shown the analysis of the total variance\\nfor each plot, divided as it may be ascribed . . . . - Ronald Fisher. 1921, Studies in Crop Variation. I. An\\nexamination of the yield of dressed grain from Broadbalk, Journal of Agricultural Science\\n\\n22.1 Overview\\nTwo-sample t procedures are designed to compare the means of two populations. Our next step is to compare the\\nmeans of several populations. We shall explain the methodology through an example. Consider the data set gathered\\nfrom the forests in Borneo.\\nExample 22.1 (Rain forest logging). The data on 30 forest plots in Borneo are the number of trees per plot.\\n\\nnever logged\\n\\nlogged 1 year ago\\n\\nlogged 8 years ago\\n\\nni\\nÂ¯yi\\nsi\\n\\n12\\n\\n23.750\\n5.065\\n\\n12\\n\\n14.083\\n4.981\\n\\n9\\n\\n15.778\\n5.761\\n\\nWe compute these statistics from the data y11, . . . y1n1,\\n\\ny21, . . . y2n2 and y31, . . . y2n2\\n\\nÂ¯yj =\\n\\n1\\nnj\\n\\nnj(cid:88)i=1\\n\\nyij\\n\\nand s2\\n\\nj =\\n\\n1\\n\\nnj â 1\\n\\nnj(cid:88)i=1\\n\\n(yij â Â¯yi)2\\n\\nOne way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a statistical procedure that allows us to test for the differences in\\nmeans for two or more independent groups. In the situation above, we have set our design so that the data in each of\\nthe three groups is a random sample from within the groups. The basic question is: Are these means the same (the null\\nhypothesis) or not (the alternative hypothesis)?\\n\\nAs the case with the t procedures, the appropriateness of one way analysis of variance is based on the applicability\\nof the central limit theorem. As with t procedures, ANOVA has an alternative, the Kruskal-Wallis test, based on the\\nranks of the data for circumstances in which the central limit theorem does not apply.\\n\\nThe basic idea of the test is to examine the ratio of s2\\n\\nbetween, the variance between the groups 1, 2, and 3. and\\nresidual, a statistic that measures the variances within the groups. If the resulting ratio test statistic is sufï¬ciently\\ns2\\nlarge, then we say, based on the data, that the means of these groups are distinct and we are able to reject the null\\nhypothesis. Even though the boxplots use different measures of center (median vs. mean) and spread (quartiles vs.\\nstandard deviation), this idea can be expressed by examining in Figure 22.1 the ï¬uctuation in the centers of boxes\\ncompared to the width of the boxes.\\n\\n403\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction to the Science of Statistics\\n\\nAnalysis of Variance\\n\\nAs we have seen before, this decision to reject H0 will\\nbe the consequence a sufï¬ciently high value of a test statis-\\ntic - in this case the F statistic. The distribution of this\\ntest statistic will depend on the number of groups (3 in the\\nexample above) and the number of total observations (33\\nin the example above). Consequently, variances between\\ngroups that are not statistically signiï¬cant for small sample\\nsizes can become signiï¬cant as the sample sizes and, with\\nit, the power increase.\\n\\n22.2 One Way Analysis of Variance\\n\\nFor one way analysis of variance, we expand to more than\\nthe two groups seen for t procedures and ask whether or not\\nthe means of all the groups are the same. The hypothesis\\nin this case is\\n\\nFigure 22.1: Side-by-side boxplots of the number of trees per plot.\\nThe groups will be considered different if the differences between the\\ngroups (indicated by the variation in the center lines of the boxes) is\\nlarge compared to the width of the boxes in the boxplot.\\n\\nH0 : Âµj = Âµk for all j, k and H1 : Âµj (cid:54)= Âµk for some j, k.\\n\\nThe data {yij, 1 â¤ i â¤ nj, 1 â¤ j â¤ q} represents that we have ni observation for the i-th group and that we have\\n\\nq groups. The total number of observations is denoted by n = n1 + Â·Â·Â· + nq. The model is\\n\\nyij = Âµj + \\x01ij.\\n\\nwhere \\x01ij are independent N (0, Ï) random variables with Ï2 unknown. This allows us to deï¬ne the likelihood and\\nto use that to determine the analysis of variance F test as a likelihood ratio test. Notice that the model for analysis\\nrequires a common value Ï for all of the observations.\\n\\nIn order to develop the F statistic at the test statistic, we will need to introduce two types of sample means:\\n\\nâ¢ The within group means is simply the sample mean of the observations inside each of the groups,\\n\\nyj =\\n\\n1\\nnj\\n\\nnj(cid:88)i=1\\n\\nyij,\\n\\nj = 1. . . . , q.\\n\\nThese are given in the table in Example 22.1 for the Borneo rains forest.

The development time for a European queen in a honey bee hive is suspected to depend on the tem-\\nperature of the hive. To examine this, queens are reared in a low temperature hive (31.1â¦ C), a medium temperature\\nhive (32.8â¦ C) and a high temperature hive (34.4â¦ C). The hypothesis is that higher temperatures increase metabolism\\nrate and thus reduce the time needed from the time the egg is laid until an adult queen honey bee emerges from the\\ncell. The hypothesis is\\n\\nH0 : Âµlow = Âµmed = Âµhigh\\n\\nversus H1 : Âµlow, Âµmed, Âµhigh differ\\n\\nwhere Âµlow, Âµmed, and Âµhigh are, respectively, the mean development time in days for queen eggs reared in a low, a\\nmedium, and a high temperature hive.

We keep to two groups in the devel-\\nopment of the F test. The essential features can be found in this example without the extra notation necessary for an\\narbitrary number of groups.\\n\\nOur hypothesis test is based on two independent samples of normal random variables. The data are\\n\\nyij = Âµj + \\x01ij.\\n\\nwhere \\x01ij are independent N (0, Ï) random variables with Ï unknown. Thus, we have nj independent N (Âµj, Ï)\\nrandom variables Y1j . . . , Ynj j with unknown common variance Ï2, j = 1 and 2. The assumption of a common\\nvariance is critical to the ability to compute the test statistics.\\n\\nConsider the two-sided hypothesis\\n\\nThus, the parameter space is\\n\\nFor the null hypothesis, the possible parameter values are\\n\\nH0 : Âµ1 = Âµ2\\n\\nversus H1 : Âµ1 (cid:54)= Âµ2.\\nÎ = {(Âµ1, Âµ2, Ï2); Âµ1, Âµ2 â R, Ï2 > 0}.\\n\\nStep 1. Determine the log-likelihood. To ï¬nd the test statistic derived from a likelihood ratio test, we ï¬rst write\\n\\nthe likelihood and its logarithm based on observations y = (y11, . . . , yn11, y12, . . . , yn22).\\n\\nÎ0 = {(Âµ1, Âµ2, Ï2); Âµ1 = Âµ2, Ï2 > 0}\\n\\nL(Âµ1.Âµ2, Ï2|y) =(cid:18) 1\\n\\nâ2ÏÏ2(cid:19)n1+n2\\n\\nexpâ\\n\\n(yi1 â Âµ1)2 +\\n\\n1\\n\\n2Ï2(cid:32) n1(cid:88)i=1\\n2Ï2(cid:32) n1(cid:88)i=1\\n\\n1\\n\\n(yi2 â Âµ2)2(cid:33)\\nn2(cid:88)i=1\\n(yi2 â Âµ2)2(cid:33)\\nn2(cid:88)i=1\\n\\n(22.3)\\n\\n(22.4)\\n\\nln L(Âµ1.Âµ2, Ï2|y) = â\\n\\n(n1 + n2)\\n\\n2\\n\\n(ln 2Ï + ln Ï2) â\\n\\n(yi1 â Âµ1)2 +\\n\\nStep 2.

The ï¬rst is the sums of squares of the difference of the average of each group mean and the\\noverall mean,\\n\\nThe second is the sums of squares of the difference of the individual observations with its own group mean, SSresiduals.\\nThus, we can write\\n\\nSSbetween = n1(y â Â¯y1)2 + n2(y â Â¯y2)2.\\n\\nSStotal = SSresidual + SSbetween\\n\\nNow, the likelihood ratio (22.7) reads\\n\\nÎ(y) =(cid:18) SSresidual + SSbetween\\n\\nSSresiduals\\n\\n(cid:19) =(cid:18)1 +\\n\\nSSbetween\\n\\nSSresiduals(cid:19)â(n1+n2)/2\\n\\nDue to the negative power in the exponent, the critical region Î(y) â¤ Î»0 is equivalent to\\n\\nSSbetween\\nSSresiduals\\n\\n=\\n\\nn1(y â Â¯y1)2 + n2(y â Â¯y2)2\\n(n1 â 1)s2\\n1 + (n2 â 1)s2\\n\\n2 â¥ c\\n\\n(22.8)\\n\\nfor an appropriate value c.

       " 'The value of statistical thinking is now accepted by researchers and practitioners from a broad range of endeavors. This viewpoint has become common wisdom in a world of big data. The challenge for statistics educators is to adapt their pedagogy to accommodate the circumstances associated to the information age. This choice of pedagogy should be attuned to the quantitative capabilities and scientific background of the students as well as the intended use of their newly acquired knowledge of statistics.',\n",
       " 'Many university students, presumed to be proficient in college algebra, are taught a variety of procedures and standard tests under a well-developed pedagogy. This approach is sufficiently refined so that students have a good intuitive understanding of the underlying principles presented in the course. However, if the statistical needs presented by a given scientific question fall outside the battery of methods presented in the standard curriculum, then students are typically at a loss to adjust the procedures to accommodate the additional demand.',\n",
       " 'On the other hand, undergraduate students majoring in mathematics frequently have a course on the theory of statistics as a part of their program of study. In this case, the standard curriculum repeatedly finds itself close to the very practically minded subject that statistics is. However, the demands of the syllabus provide very little time to explore these applications with any sustained attention.',\n",
       " 'Our goal is to find a middle ground.',\n",
       " 'Despite the fact that calculus is a routine tool in the development of statistics, the benefits to students who have learned calculus are infrequently employed in the statistics curriculum. The objective of this book is to meet this need with a one semester course in statistics that moves forward in recognition of the coherent body of knowledge provided by statistical theory having an eye consistently on the application of the subject. Such a course may not be able to achieve the same degree of completeness now presented by the two more standard courses described above. However, it ought to able to achieve some important goals:',\n",
       " 'leaving students capable of understanding what statistical thinking is and how to integrate this with scientific procedures and quantitative modeling and',\n",
       " 'learning how to ask statistics experts productive questions, and how to implement their ideas using statistical software and other computational tools.',\n",
       " 'Inevitably, many important topics are not included in this book. In addition, I have chosen to incorporate abbre-viated introductions of some more advanced topics. Such topics can be skipped in a first pass through the material. However, one value of a textbook is that it can serve as a reference in future years. The context for some parts of the exposition will become more clear as students continue their own education in statistics. In these cases, the more advanced pieces can serve as a bridge from this book to more well developed accounts. My goal is not to compose a stand alone treatise, but rather to build a foundation that allows those who have worked through this book to introduce themselves to many exciting topics both in statistics and in its areas of application.',\n",

       " 'Introduction to the Science of Statistics',\n",

       " 'Who Should Use this Book',\n",
       " 'The major prerequisites are comfort with calculus and a strong interest in questions that can benefit from statistical analysis. Willingness to engage in explorations utilizing statistical software is an important additional requirement. The original audience for the course associated to this book are undergraduate students minoring in mathematics. These student have typically completed a course in multivariate calculus. Many have been exposed to either linear algebra or differential equations. They enroll in this course because they want to obtain a better understanding of their own core subject. Even though we regularly rely on the mechanics of calculus and occasionally need to work with matrices, this is not a textbook for a mathematics course, but rather a textbook that is dedicated to a higher level of understanding of the concepts and practical applications of statistics. In this regard, it relies on a solid grasp of concepts and structures in calculus and algebra.',\n",
       " 'With the advance and adoption of the Common Core State Standards in mathematics, we can anticipate that primary and secondary school students will experience a broader exposure to statistics through their school years. As a consequence, we will need to develop a curriculum for teachers and future teachers so that they can take content in statistics and turn that into curriculum for their students. This book can serve as a source of that content.',\n",
       " 'In addition, those engaged both in industry and in scholarly research are experiencing a surge in the need to design more complex experiments and analyze more diverse data types. Universities and industry are responding with advanced educational opportunities to extend statistics education beyond the theory of probability and statistics, linear models and design of experiments to more modern approaches that include stochastic processes, machine learning and data mining, Bayesian statistics, and statistical computing. This book can serve as an entry point for these critical topics in statistics.',\n",
       " 'An Annotated Syllabus',\n",
       " 'The four parts of the course - organizing and collecting data, an introduction to probability, estimation procedures and hypothesis testing - are the building blocks of many statistics courses. We highlight some of the particular features in this book.',\n",
       " 'Organizing and Collecting Data',\n",

We use this as an opportunity to introduce to the statistical software package R and to add additional summaries like the empirical cu-mulative distribution function and the empirical survival function. One example incorporating the use of this is the comparison of the lifetimes of wildtype and transgenic mosquitoes and a discussion of the best strategy to display and summarize data if the goal is to examine the differences in these two genotypes of mosquitoes in their ability to carry and spread malaria.

Conditional probability is necessary to develop Bayes formula which we will later use to give a taste of the Bayesian approach to statistics. Independence will be needed to describe the likelihood function in the case of an experimental design that is based on independent observations. Densities for continuous random variables and mass function for discrete random variables are necessary to write these likelihood functions explicitly.

Some, like the binomial, negative binomial, Poisson or the gamma random variable, arise from considerations based on Bernoulli trials or exponential waiting. The hyperge-ometric random variable helps us understand the difference between sampling with and without replacement. The F , t and chi-square random variables will later become test statistics. Uniform random variables are the ones simulated by random number generators. Because of the central limit theorem, the normal family is the most important among the list of parametric families of random variables.',\n",

These are largely developed using simulation explorations and first applied to simple Monte Carlo techniques and importance sampling to estimate the value of an definite integrals. One cautionary tale is an example of the failure of these simulation techniques when applied without careful analysis. If one uses, for example, Cauchy random variables in the evaluation of some quantity, then the simulated sample means can appear to be converging only to experience an abrupt and unpredictable jump. The lack of convergence of an improper integral reveals the difficulty. The central object of study is, of course, the central limit theorem. It is developed both in terms of sample sums and sample means and proportions and used in relatively standard ways to estimate probabilities. However, in this book, we can introduce the delta method which adds ideas associated to the central limit theorem to the context of propagation of error.',\n",

We look to two types of estimation techniques - method of moments and maximum likelihood and several criteria for an estimator using, for example, variance and bias. Several examples including mark and recapture and the distribution of fitness effects from genetic data are developed for both types of estimators. The variance of an estimator is approximated using the delta method for method of moments estimators and using Fisher information for maximum likelihood estimators. An analysis of bias is based on quadratic Taylor series approximations and the properties of expectations. Both classes of estimators are often consistent. This implies that the bias decreases towards zero with an increasing number of observations. R is routinely used in simulations to gain insight into the quality of estimators.',\n",

The US petroleum industry began with Edwin Drakeâs drilling of a 69-foot deep oil well in 1859 on Oil Creek near Titusville, Pennsylvania for the Seneca Oil Company. The industry grew through the 1800s, driven by the demand for kerosene and oil lamps. The introduction of the internal combustion engine in the early part of the 20th century provided a demand that has largely sustained the industry to this day. Today, about 90% of vehicular fuel needs are met by oil. Petroleum also makes up 40% of total energy consumption in the United States, but is responsible for only 2% of electricity generation.

       "  'There are two main branches of statistics: descriptive and inferential. Descrip-tive statistics is used to say something about a set of information that has been collected only. Inferential statistics is used to make predictions or comparisons about a larger group (a population) using information gathered about a small part of that population. Thus, inferential statistics involves generalizing beyond the data, something that descriptive statistics does not do.',\n",
       "  'Other distinctions are sometimes made between data types.',\n",
       "  'Discrete data are whole numbers, and are usually a count of objects. (For instance, one study might count how many pets diï¬erent families own; it wouldnât make sense to have half a goldfish, would it?)',\n",
       "  'Measured data, in contrast to discrete data, are continuous, and thus may take on any real value. (For example, the amount of time a group of chil-dren spent watching TV would be measured data, since they could watch any number of hours, even though their watching habits will probably be some multiple of 30 minutes.)',\n",
       "  'Numerical data are numbers.',\n",
       "  'Categorical data have labels (i.e. words). (For example, a list of the prod-ucts bought by diï¬erent families at a grocery store would be categorical data, since it would go something like {milk, eggs, toilet paper, . . . }.)',\n",

       "  'The median is the middle number of a set of numbers arranged in numerical order. If the number of values in a set is even, then the median is the sum of the two middle values, divided by 2.',\n",
       "  'The median is not aï¬ected by the magnitude of the extreme (smallest or largest) values. Thus, it is useful because it is not aï¬ected by one or two abnormally small or large values, and because it is very simple to calculate. (For example, to obtain a relatively accurate average life of a particular type of lightbulb, you could measure the median life by installing several bulbs and measuring how much time passed before half of them died. Alternatives would probably involve measuring the life of each bulb.)',\n",

On the other hand, the fact that the mode is absolute (for example, 2.9999 and 3 are considered just as diï¬erent as 3 and 100 are) can make the mode a poor choice for determing a âcenterâ. For example, the mode of the set {1, 2.3, 2.3, 5.14, 5.15, 5.16, 5.17, 5.18, 10.2} is 2.3, even though there are many values that are close to, but not exactly equal to, 5.16.',\n",
