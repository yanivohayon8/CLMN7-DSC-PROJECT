       "'Chapter 3\\n\\nProbability and Information\\nTheory\\n\\nIn this chapter, we describe probability theory and information theory.\\n\\nProbability theory is a mathematical framework for representing uncertain\\nstatements. It provides a means of quantifying uncertainty and axioms for deriving\\nnew uncertain statements. In artiï¬cial intelligence applications, we use probability\\ntheory in two major ways. First, the laws of probability tell us how AI systems\\nshould reason, so we design our algorithms to compute or approximate various\\nexpressions derived using probability theory. Second, we can use probability and\\nstatistics to theoretically analyze the behavior of proposed AI systems.\\n\\nProbability theory is a fundamental tool of many disciplines of science and\\nengineering. We provide this chapter to ensure that readers whose background is\\nprimarily in software engineering with limited exposure to probability theory can\\nunderstand the material in this book.\\n\\nWhile probability theory allows us to make uncertain statements and reason\\nin the presence of uncertainty, information allows us to quantify the amount of\\nuncertainty in a probability distribution.\\n\\nIf you are already familiar with probability theory and information theory,\\nyou may wish to skip all of this chapter except for Sec. 3.14, which describes the\\ngraphs we use to describe structured probabilistic models for machine learning. If\\nyou have absolutely no prior experience with these subjects, this chapter should\\nbe suï¬cient to successfully carry out deep learning research projects, but we do\\nsuggest that you consult an additional resource, such as Jaynes (2003).\\n\\n52\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\n3.1 Why Probability?\\n\\nMany branches of computer science deal mostly with entities that are entirely\\ndeterministic and certain. A programmer can usually safely assume that a CPU will\\nexecute each machine instruction ï¬awlessly. Errors in hardware do occur, but are\\nrare enough that most software applications do not need to be designed to account\\nfor them. Given that many computer scientists and software engineers work in a\\nrelatively clean and certain environment, it can be surprising that machine learning\\nmakes heavy use of probability theory.\\n\\nThis is because machine learning must always deal with uncertain quantities,\\nand sometimes may also need to deal with stochastic (non-deterministic) quantities.\\nUncertainty and stochasticity can arise from many sources. Researchers have made\\ncompelling arguments for quantifying uncertainty using probability since at least\\nthe 1980s. Many of the arguments presented here are summarized from or inspired\\nby Pearl (1988).\\n\\nNearly all activities require some ability to reason in the presence of uncertainty.\\nIn fact, beyond mathematical statements that are true by deï¬nition, it is diï¬cult\\nto think of any proposition that is absolutely true or any event that is absolutely\\nguaranteed to occur.\\n\\nThere are three possible sources of uncertainty:\\n\\n1. Inherent stochasticity in the system being modeled. For example, most\\ninterpretations of quantum mechanics describe the dynamics of subatomic\\nparticles as being probabilistic. We can also create theoretical scenarios that\\nwe postulate to have random dynamics, such as a hypothetical card game\\nwhere we assume that the cards are truly shuï¬ed into a random order.\\n\\n2. Incomplete observability. Even deterministic systems can appear stochastic\\nwhen we cannot observe all of the variables that drive the behavior of the\\nsystem. For example, in the Monty Hall problem, a game show contestant is\\nasked to choose between three doors and wins a prize held behind the chosen\\ndoor. Two doors lead to a goat while a third leads to a car. The outcome\\ngiven the contestantâs choice is deterministic, but from the contestantâs point\\nof view, the outcome is uncertain.\\n\\n3. Incomplete modeling. When we use a model that must discard some of\\nthe information we have observed, the discarded information results in\\nuncertainty in the modelâs predictions. For example, suppose we build a\\nrobot that can exactly observe the location of every object around it. If the\\n\\n53\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nrobot discretizes space when predicting the future location of these objects,\\nthen the discretization makes the robot immediately become uncertain about\\nthe precise position of objects: each object could be anywhere within the\\ndiscrete cell that it was observed to occupy.\\n\\nIn many cases, it is more practical to use a simple but uncertain rule rather\\nthan a complex but certain one, even if the true rule is deterministic and our\\nmodeling system has the ï¬delity to accommodate a complex rule. For example, the\\nsimple rule âMost birds ï¬yâ is cheap to develop and is broadly useful, while a rule\\nof the form, âBirds ï¬y, except for very young birds that have not yet learned to\\nï¬y, sick or injured birds that have lost the ability to ï¬y, ï¬ightless species of birds\\nincluding the cassowary, ostrich and kiwi. . . â is expensive to develop, maintain and\\ncommunicate, and after all of this eï¬ort is still very brittle and prone to failure.\\n\\nGiven that we need a means of representing and reasoning about uncertainty,\\nit is not immediately obvious that probability theory can provide all of the tools\\nwe want for artiï¬cial intelligence applications. Probability theory was originally\\ndeveloped to analyze the frequencies of events. It is easy to see how probability\\ntheory can be used to study events like drawing a certain hand of cards in a\\ngame of poker. These kinds of events are often repeatable. When we say that\\nan outcome has a probability p of occurring, it means that if we repeated the\\nexperiment (e.g., draw a hand of cards) inï¬nitely many times, then proportion p\\nof the repetitions would result in that outcome. This kind of reasoning does not\\nseem immediately applicable to propositions that are not repeatable. If a doctor\\nanalyzes a patient and says that the patient has a 40% chance of having the ï¬u,\\nthis means something very diï¬erentâwe can not make inï¬nitely many replicas of\\nthe patient, nor is there any reason to believe that diï¬erent replicas of the patient\\nwould present with the same symptoms yet have varying underlying conditions. In\\nthe case of the doctor diagnosing the patient, we use probability to represent a\\ndegree of belief, with 1 indicating absolute certainty that the patient has the ï¬u\\nand 0 indicating absolute certainty that the patient does not have the ï¬u. The\\nformer kind of probability, related directly to the rates at which events occur, is\\nknown as frequentist probability, while the latter, related to qualitative levels of\\ncertainty, is known as Bayesian probability.\\n\\nIf we list several properties that we expect common sense reasoning about\\nuncertainty to have, then the only way to satisfy those properties is to treat\\nBayesian probabilities as behaving exactly the same as frequentist probabilities.\\nFor example, if we want to compute the probability that a player will win a poker\\ngame given that she has a certain set of cards, we use exactly the same formulas\\nas when we compute the probability that a patient has a disease given that she\\n\\n54\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nhas certain symptoms. For more details about why a small set of common sense\\nassumptions implies that the same axioms must control both kinds of probability,\\nsee Ramsey (1926).\\n\\nProbability can be seen as the extension of logic to deal with uncertainty. Logic\\nprovides a set of formal rules for determining what propositions are implied to\\nbe true or false given the assumption that some other set of propositions is true\\nor false. Probability theory provides a set of formal rules for determining the\\nlikelihood of a proposition being true given the likelihood of other propositions.\\n\\n3.2 Random Variables\\n\\nA random variable is a variable that can take on diï¬erent values randomly. We\\ntypically denote the random variable itself with a lower case letter in plain typeface,\\nand the values it can take on with lower case script letters. For example, x1 and x2\\nare both possible values that the random variable x can take on. For vector-valued\\nvariables, we would write the random variable as x and one of its values as x. On\\nits own, a random variable is just a description of the states that are possible; it\\nmust be coupled with a probability distribution that speciï¬es how likely each of\\nthese states are.\\n\\nRandom variables may be discrete or continuous. A discrete random variable\\nis one that has a ï¬nite or countably inï¬nite number of states. Note that these\\nstates are not necessarily the integers; they can also just be named states that\\nare not considered to have any numerical value. A continuous random variable is\\nassociated with a real value.\\n\\n3.3 Probability Distributions\\n\\nA probability distribution is a description of how likely a random variable or\\nset of random variables is to take on each of its possible states. The way we\\ndescribe probability distributions depends on whether the variables are discrete or\\ncontinuous.\\n\\n3.3.1 Discrete Variables and Probability Mass Functions\\n\\nA probability distribution over discrete variables may be described using a proba-\\nbility mass function (PMF). We typically denote probability mass functions with a\\ncapital P . Often we associate each random variable with a diï¬erent probability\\n\\n55\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3.

The probability\\nthat x = x is denoted as P (x), with a probability of 1 indicating that x = x is\\ncertain and a probability of 0 indicating that x = x is impossible. Sometimes\\nto disambiguate which PMF to use, we write the name of the random variable\\nexplicitly: P (x = x). Sometimes we deï¬ne a variable ï¬rst, then use â¼ notation to\\nspecify which distribution it follows later: x â¼ P (x .)\\n\\nProbability mass functions can act on many variables at the same time. Such\\na probability distribution over many variables is known as a joint probability\\ndistribution. P (x = x, y = y) denotes the probability that x = x and y = y\\nsimultaneously.

PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\n3.3.2 Continuous Variables and Probability Density Functions\\n\\nWhen working with continuous random variables, we describe probability dis-\\ntributions using a probability density function (PDF) rather than a probability\\nmass function. To be a probability density function, a function p must satisfy the\\nfollowing properties:\\n\\np\\n\\nâ¢ The domain of must be the set of all possible states of x.\\nâ¢ âx\\n\\n0â¥ Note that we do not require ( ) \\np x\\n\\n1â¤ .\\n\\n.\\n\\nâ x ( ) \\n, p x\\n( ) = 1.\\n\\nâ¢ \\ue052 p x dx\\n\\nA probability density function p(x) does not give the probability of a speciï¬c\\nstate directly, instead the probability of landing inside an inï¬nitesimal region with\\nvolume\\n\\nis given by\\n\\np x Î´x\\n\\n( )\\n\\nÎ´x\\n\\n.\\n\\nWe can integrate the density function to ï¬nd the actual probability mass of a\\nset of points. Speciï¬cally, the probability that x lies in some set S is given by the\\nintegral of p(x) over that set. In the univariate example, the probability that x\\nlies in the interval\\n\\nis given by\\n\\n.\\np x dx\\n\\n[\\n]a, b\\n\\n( )\\n\\nFor an example of a probability density function corresponding to a speciï¬c\\nprobability density over a continuous random variable, consider a uniform distribu-\\ntion on an interval of the real numbers. We can do this with a function u (x; a, b),\\nwhere a and b are the endpoints of the interval, with b > a. The â;â notation means\\nâparametrized byâ; we consider x to be the argument of the function, while a and\\nb are parameters that deï¬ne the function. To ensure that there is no probability\\nmass outside the interval, we say u(x; a, b) = 0 for all x \\ue036â [a, b]\\n. Within a, b],\\n. We can see that this is nonnegative everywhere.

The probability\\ndistribution over the subset is known as the marginal probability distribution.\\n\\nFor example, suppose we have discrete random variables x and y , and we know\\n\\nP ,(x y .

PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nThe name âmarginal probabilityâ comes from the process of computing marginal\\nprobabilities on paper. When the values of P(x y, ) are written in a grid with\\ndiï¬erent values of x in rows and diï¬erent values of y in columns, it is natural to\\nsum across a row of the grid, then write P( x) in the margin of the paper just to\\nthe right of the row.\\n\\nFor continuous variables, we need to use integration instead of summation:\\n\\np x( ) =\\ue05a p x, y dy.\\n\\n(\\n\\n)\\n\\n(3.4)\\n\\n3.5 Conditional Probability\\n\\nIn many cases, we are interested in the probability of some event, given that some\\nother event has happened. This is called a conditional probability. We denote\\nthe conditional probability that y = y given x = x as P (y = y | x = x ). This\\nconditional probability can be computed with the formula\\n\\nP\\n\\n( = y\\n\\ny\\n\\n| x =  ) =\\n\\nx\\n\\nP\\n\\n( = y\\n\\ny,\\n\\nx =  )\\nx\\nx\\n)\\n\\nP\\n\\n( = x\\n\\n.\\n\\n(3.5)\\n\\nThe conditional probability is only deï¬ned when P (x = x) > 0. We cannot compute\\nthe conditional probability conditioned on an event that never happens.\\n\\nIt is important not to confuse conditional probability with computing what\\nwould happen if some action were undertaken. The conditional probability that\\na person is from Germany given that they speak German is quite high, but if\\na randomly selected person is taught to speak German, their country of origin\\ndoes not change. Computing the consequences of an action is called making an\\nintervention query. Intervention queries are the domain of causal modeling, which\\nwe do not explore in this book.\\n\\n3.6 The Chain Rule of Conditional Probabilities\\n\\nAny joint probability distribution over many random variables may be decomposed\\ninto conditional distributions over only one variable:\\n\\nP (x(1), . . . , x ( )n ) = \\n\\n| x(1), . . . , x (\\nproduct rule of probability.

For discrete variables this can be computed with a summation:\\n\\nexpected value\\n\\nP\\n\\nExâ¼P[ (f x)] =\\ue058x\\n\\nP x f x ,\\n( ) ( )\\n\\n(3.9)\\n\\nwhile for continuous variables, it is computed with an integral:\\n\\nExâ¼p[ ( )] =\\n\\nf x\\n\\n\\ue05a p x f x dx.\\n\\n( ) ( )\\n\\n59\\n\\n(3.10)\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nWhen the identity of the distribution is clear from the context, we may simply\\nwrite the name of the random variable that the expectation is over, as in Ex[f (x)].\\nIf it is clear which random variable the expectation is over, we may omit the\\nsubscript entirely, as in E[f (x)]. By default, we can assume that E [Â·] averages over\\nthe values of all the random variables inside the brackets. Likewise, when there is\\nno ambiguity, we may omit the square brackets.\\n\\nExpectations are linear, for example,\\n\\nE x[\\n\\nÎ±f x\\n\\n( ) + ( )] = \\n\\nÎ²g x\\n\\nÎ±Ex [ ( )] +\\n\\nf x\\n\\nÎ²Ex[ ( )]\\ng x ,\\n\\n(3.11)\\n\\nwhen\\n\\nÎ±\\n\\nand\\n\\nÎ²\\n\\nare not dependent on .\\nx\\n\\nThe variance gives a measure of how much the values of a function of a random\\nvariable x vary as we sample diï¬erent value of x from its probability distribution:\\n\\nVar( ( )) = \\n\\nf x\\n\\nE\\ue068( ( )\\nf x â E f x 2\\ue069.\\n\\n[ ( )])\\n\\n(3.12)\\n\\nWhen the variance is low, the values of f (x) cluster near their expected value. The\\nsquare root of the variance is known as the standard deviation.\\n\\nThe covariance gives some sense of how much two values are linearly related to\\n\\neach other, as well as the scale of these variables:\\n\\nCov( ( )\\n\\nf x , g y\\n\\n( )) = \\n\\nE f x â E f x\\n[( ( )\\n\\n[ ( )]) ( ( )\\n\\ng y â E g y\\n\\n[ ( )])]\\n\\n.\\n\\n(3.13)\\n\\nHigh absolute values of the covariance mean that the values change very much\\nand are both far from their respective means at the same time. If the sign of the\\ncovariance is positive, then both variables tend to take on relatively high values\\nsimultaneously. If the sign of the covariance is negative, then one variable tends to\\ntake on a relatively high value at the times that the other takes on a relatively low\\nvalue and vice versa. Other measures such as correlation normalize the contribution\\nof each variable in order to measure only how much the variables are related, rather\\nthan also being aï¬ected by the scale of the separate variables.\\n\\nThe notions of covariance and dependence are related, but are in fact distinct\\nconcepts. They are related because two variables that are independent have zero\\ncovariance, and two variables that have non-zero covariance are dependent. How-\\never, independence is a distinct property from covariance. For two variables to have\\nzero covariance, there must be no linear dependence between them. Independence\\nis a stronger requirement than zero covariance, because independence also excludes\\nnonlinear relationships. It is possible for two variables to be dependent but have\\nzero covariance. For example, suppose we ï¬rst sample a real number x from a\\nuniform distribution over the interval [â1 ,1]. We next sample a random variable\\n\\n60\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\ns. With probability 1\\n2, we choose the value of s to be 1. Otherwise, we choose\\nthe value of s to be â 1. We can then generate a random variable y by assigning\\ny = sx .

The multinoulli distribution is\\n\\nor\\n\\n1 âMultinoulliâ is a term that was recently coined by Gustavo Lacerdo and popularized by\\nMurphy (2012). The multinoulli distribution is a special case of the\\ndistribution. A\\nmultinomial distribution is the distribution over vectors in {0, . . . , n}k representing how many\\ntimes each of the k categories is visited when n samples are drawn from a multinoulli distribution.\\nMany texts use the term âmultinomialâ to refer to multinoulli distributions without clarifying\\nthat they refer only to the\\n\\nmultinomial\\n\\nn = 1\\n\\ncase.\\n\\n61\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nparametrized by a vector p â [0, 1]kâ1 , where p i gives the probability of the i-th\\nstate. The ï¬nal, k-th stateâs probability is given by 1â 1\\ue03e p. Note that we must\\nconstrain 1 \\ue03ep â¤ 1. Multinoulli distributions are often used to refer to distributions\\nover categories of objects, so we do not usually assume that state 1 has numerical\\nvalue 1, etc. For this reason, we do not usually need to compute the expectation\\nor variance of multinoulli-distributed random variables.\\n\\nThe Bernoulli and multinoulli distributions are suï¬cient to describe any distri-\\nbution over their domain. This is because they model discrete variables for which\\nit is feasible to simply enumerate all of the states. When dealing with continuous\\nvariables, there are uncountably many states, so any distribution described by a\\nsmall number of parameters must impose strict limits on the distribution.\\n\\n3.9.3 Gaussian Distribution\\n\\nThe most commonly used distribution over real numbers is the normal distribution,\\nalso known as the Gaussian distribution:\\n\\nN ( ;x Âµ, Ï2) =\\ue072 1\\n\\n2ÏÏ2 exp\\ue012â\\n\\n1\\nx\\n2Ï2 (\\n\\nÂµâ 2\\ue013 .\\n\\n)\\n\\n(3.21)\\n\\nSee Fig. 3.1 for a plot of the density function.\\nThe two parameters Âµ â R and Ï â (0,â ) control the normal distribution.\\nThe parameter Âµ gives the coordinate of the central peak. This is also the mean of\\nthe distribution: E[x] = Âµ. The standard deviation of the distribution is given by\\nÏ, and the variance by Ï2.\\n\\nWhen we evaluate the PDF, we need to square and invert Ï. When we need to\\nfrequently evaluate the PDF with diï¬erent parameter values, a more eï¬cient way\\nof parametrizing the distribution is to use a parameter Î² â (0 ,â) to control the\\nprecision or inverse variance of the distribution:\\n\\nN ( ;x Âµ, Î²â1) =\\ue072 Î²\\n\\n2Ï\\n\\nexp\\ue012â\\n\\n1\\n2\\n\\nÎ² x\\n\\n( â )2\\ue013 .\\n\\nÂµ\\n\\n(3.22)\\n\\nNormal distributions are a sensible choice for many applications. In the absence\\nof prior knowledge about what form a distribution over the real numbers should\\ntake, the normal distribution is a good default choice for two major reasons.\\n\\nFirst, many distributions we wish to model are truly close to being normal\\ndistributions. The central limit theorem shows that the sum of many independent\\nrandom variables is approximately normally distributed. This means that in\\n\\n62\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3.

We can thus think of the normal distribution as being the one that\\ninserts the least amount of prior knowledge into a model. Fully developing and\\njustifying this idea requires more mathematical tools, and is postponed to Sec.\\n19.4.2.\\n\\nThe normal distribution generalizes to Rn, in which case it is known as the\\nmultivariate normal distribution.

PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nmany diï¬erent values of the parameters, the covariance is not a computationally\\neï¬cient way to parametrize the distribution, since we need to invert Î£ to evaluate\\nthe PDF.

To accomplish this, we can use the exponential\\ndistribution:\\n\\n(3.25)\\nThe exponential distribution uses the indicator function 1xâ¥0 to assign probability\\nzero to all negative values of\\n\\np x Î»\\n( ; ) =  1xâ¥0exp (\\n\\n)âÎ»x .\\n\\n.x\\n\\nÎ»\\n\\nA closely related probability distribution that allows us to place a sharp peak\\n\\nof probability mass at an arbitrary point\\n\\nÂµ\\n\\nis the\\n\\nLaplace distribution\\n\\nLaplace( ;\\n\\nx Âµ, Î³\\n\\n) =\\n\\n1\\n2Î³\\n\\nexp\\ue012â| â |\\nÎ³ \\ue013.\\n\\nÂµ\\n\\nx\\n\\n(3.26)\\n\\n3.9.5 The Dirac Distribution and Empirical Distribution\\n\\nIn some cases, we wish to specify that all of the mass in a probability distribution\\nclusters around a single point.

The Dirac delta function is not an ordinary function that\\nassociates each value x with a real-valued output, instead it is a diï¬erent kind of\\nmathematical object called a generalized function that is deï¬ned in terms of its\\nproperties when integrated. We can think of the Dirac delta function as being the\\nlimit point of a series of functions that put less and less mass on all points other\\nthan .Âµ\\n\\n64\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nBy deï¬ning p(x) to be Î´ shifted by âÂµ we obtain an inï¬nitely narrow and\\n\\ninï¬nitely high peak of probability mass where\\n\\nx\\n\\nÂµ= \\n\\n.\\n\\nA common use of the Dirac delta distribution is as a component of an empirical\\n\\ndistribution,\\n\\nËp( ) =x\\n\\n1\\nm\\n\\nm\\ue058i=1\\n\\nÎ´(x xâ ( )i )\\n\\n(3.28)\\n\\n1\\nm on each of the m points x(1), . . . , x (\\n\\n)m forming\\nwhich puts probability mass\\na given data set or collection of samples. The Dirac delta distribution is only\\nnecessary to deï¬ne the empirical distribution over continuous variables. For discrete\\nvariables, the situation is simpler: an empirical distribution can be conceptualized\\nas a multinoulli distribution, with a probability associated to each possible input\\nvalue that is simply equal to the empirical frequency of that value in the training\\nset.\\n\\nWe can view the empirical distribution formed from a dataset of training\\nexamples as specifying the distribution that we sample from when we train a model\\non this dataset. Another important perspective on the empirical distribution is\\nthat it is the probability density that maximizes the likelihood of the training\\ndata (see Sec. 5.5). Many machine learning algorithms can be conï¬gured to have\\narbitrarily high capacity. If given enough capacity, these algorithms will simply\\nlearn the empirical distribution. This is a bad outcome because the model does not\\ngeneralize at all and assigns inï¬nitesimal probability to any point in space that did\\nnot occur in the training set. A central problem in machine learning is studying\\nhow to limit the capacity of a model in a way that prevents it from simply learning\\nthe empirical distribution while also allowing it to learn complicated functions.\\n\\n3.9.6 Mixtures of Distributions\\n\\nIt is also common to deï¬ne probability distributions by combining other simpler\\nprobability distributions. One common way of combining distributions is to\\nconstruct a mixture distribution. A mixture distribution is made up of several\\ncomponent distributions. On each trial, the choice of which component distribution\\ngenerates the sample is determined by sampling a component identity from a\\nmultinoulli distribution:\\n\\nP ( ) =x \\ue058i\\n\\nP\\n\\nc\\n( = \\n\\ni P\\n)\\n\\nx c|\\n(\\n\\n=\\n\\ni\\n)\\n\\n(3.29)\\n\\nwhere\\n\\nP ( )\\n\\nc is the multinoulli distribution over component identities.\\n\\n65\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nWe have already seen one example of a mixture distribution: the empirical\\ndistribution over real-valued variables is a mixture distribution with one Dirac\\ncomponent for each training example.\\n\\nThe mixture model is one simple strategy for combining probability distributions\\nto create a richer distribution. In Chapter 16, we explore the art of building complex\\nprobability distributions from simple ones in more detail.\\n\\nlatent variable\\n\\nThe mixture model allows us to brieï¬y glimpse a concept that will be of\\nparamount importance laterâthe\\n. A latent variable is a random\\nvariable that we cannot observe directly. The component identity variable c of the\\nmixture model provides an example. Latent variables may be related to x through\\nthe joint distribution, in this case, P (x c, ) = P (x c|\\n)P(c). The distribution P (c)\\nover the latent variable and the distribution P (x c| ) relating the latent variables\\nto the visible variables determines the shape of the distribution P ( x) even though\\nit is possible to describe P (x) without reference to the latent variable. Latent\\nvariables are discussed further in Sec. 16.5.\\n\\nA very powerful and common type of mixture model is the Gaussian mixture\\nmodel, in which the components p (x | c = i) are Gaussians. Each component has\\na separately parametrized mean Âµ ( )i and covariance Î£ ( )i . Some mixtures can have\\nmore constraints. For example, the covariances could be shared across components\\nvia the constraint Î£( )i = Î£âi. As with a single Gaussian distribution, the mixture\\nof Gaussians might constrain the covariance matrix for each component to be\\ndiagonal or isotropic.\\n\\nIn addition to the means and covariances, the parameters of a Gaussian mixture\\nspecify the prior probability Î± i = P (c = i) given to each component i. The word\\nâpriorâ indicates that it expresses the modelâs beliefs about c before it has observed\\nx. By comparison, P(c | x) is a posterior probability, because it is computed after\\nobservation of x. A Gaussian mixture model is a universal approximator of\\ndensities, in the sense that any smooth density can be approximated with any\\nspeciï¬c, non-zero amount of error by a Gaussian mixture model with enough\\ncomponents.\\n\\nFig. 3.2 shows samples from a Gaussian mixture model.\\n\\n3.10 Useful Properties of Common Functions\\n\\nCertain functions arise often while working with probability distributions, especially\\nthe probability distributions used in deep learning models.\\n\\n66\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3.

From left to right, the ï¬rst component has an isotropic covariance matrix,\\nmeaning it has the same amount of variance in each direction. The second has a diagonal\\ncovariane matrix, meaning it can control the variance separately along each axis-aligned\\ndirection. This example has more variance along the x2 axis than along the x1 axis. The\\nthird component has a full-rank covariance matrix, allowing it to control the variance\\nseparately along an abitrary basis of directions.\\n\\nOne of these functions is the logistic sigmoid:\\n\\nÏ x( ) =\\n\\n1\\n\\n1 + exp(\\n\\n.\\n)âx\\n\\n(3.30)\\n\\nThe logistic sigmoid is commonly used to produce the Ï parameter of a Bernoulli\\ndistribution because its range is (0, 1), which lies within the valid range of values\\nfor the Ï parameter.

PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\n3.12 Technical Details of Continuous Variables\\n\\nA proper formal understanding of continuous random variables and probability\\ndensity functions requires developing probability theory in terms of a branch of\\nmathematics known as measure theory. Measure theory is beyond the scope of\\nthis textbook, but we can brieï¬y sketch some of the issues that measure theory is\\nemployed to resolve.\\n\\nIn Sec. 3.3.2, we saw that the probability of a continuous vector-valued x lying\\nin some set S is given by the integral of p(x ) over the set S. Some choices of set S\\ncan produce paradoxes. For example, it is possible to construct two sets S1 and\\nS2 such that p(x â S1) + p(x â S 2) > 1 but S1 â© S2 = â. These sets are generally\\nconstructed making very heavy use of the inï¬nite precision of real numbers, for\\nexample by making fractal-shaped sets or sets that are deï¬ned by transforming\\nthe set of rational numbers2 . One of the key contributions of measure theory is to\\nprovide a characterization of the set of sets that we can compute the probability\\nof without encountering paradoxes. In this book, we only integrate over sets with\\nrelatively simple descriptions, so this aspect of measure theory never becomes a\\nrelevant concern.\\n\\nFor our purposes, measure theory is more useful for describing theorems that\\napply to most points in Rn but do not apply to some corner cases. Measure theory\\nprovides a rigorous way of describing that a set of points is negligibly small. Such\\na set is said to have âmeasure zero.â We do not formally deï¬ne this concept in this\\ntextbook. However, it is useful to understand the intuition that a set of measure\\nzero occupies no volume in the space we are measuring. For example, within R2 , a\\nline has measure zero, while a ï¬lled polygon has positive measure. Likewise, an\\nindividual point has measure zero. Any union of countably many sets that each\\nhave measure zero also has measure zero (so the set of all the rational numbers\\nhas measure zero, for instance).\\n\\nAnother useful term from measure theory is âalmost everywhere.â A property\\nthat holds almost everywhere holds throughout all of space except for on a set of\\nmeasure zero. Because the exceptions occupy a negligible amount of space, they\\ncan be safely ignored for many applications. Some important results in probability\\ntheory hold for all discrete values but only hold âalmost everywhereâ for continuous\\nvalues.\\n\\nAnother technical detail of continuous variables relates to handling continuous\\nrandom variables that are deterministic functions of one another. Suppose we have\\ntwo random variables, x and y, such that y = g(x), where g is an invertible, con-\\n\\n2The Banach-Tarski theorem provides a fun example of such sets.\\n\\n70\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\ntinuous, diï¬erentiable transformation. One might expect that py(y ) =p x(gâ1(y )).\\nThis is actually not the case.\\n\\nAs a simple example, suppose we have scalar random variables x and y. Suppose\\nIf we use the rule p y(y) = p x(2 y) then py will be 0\\non this interval. This means\\n\\ny = x\\neverywhere except the interval [0 , 1\\n2 ]\\n\\n2 and x â¼ U(0,1).\\n\\n, and it will be\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\ue05a py ( ) =\\n\\ny dy\\n\\n1\\n2\\n\\n,\\n\\n(3.43)\\n\\nwhich violates the deï¬nition of a probability distribution.\\n\\nThis common mistake is wrong because it fails to account for the distortion\\nof space introduced by the function g. Recall that the probability of x lying in\\nan inï¬nitesimally small region with volume Î´x is given by p( x)Î´x. Since g can\\nexpand or contract space, the inï¬nitesimal volume surrounding x in x space may\\nhave diï¬erent volume in\\n\\nspace.\\n\\ny\\n\\nTo see how to correct the problem, we return to the scalar case. We need to\\n\\npreserve the property\\n\\nSolving from this, we obtain\\n\\n|py( ( ))\\n\\ng x dy|\\n\\n=\\n\\n|p x( )x dx .|\\n\\nor equivalently\\n\\nIn higher dimensions, the derivative generalizes to the determinant of the Jacobian\\nmatrixâthe matrix with J i,j = âxi\\nâyj\\n\\n.

It was originally invented\\nto study sending messages from discrete alphabets over a noisy channel, such as\\ncommunication via radio transmission. In this context, information theory tells how\\nto design optimal codes and calculate the expected length of messages sampled from\\n\\n71\\n\\n(3.44)\\n\\n(3.45)\\n\\n(3.46)\\n\\n(3.47)\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nspeciï¬c probability distributions using various encoding schemes. In the context of\\nmachine learning, we can also apply information theory to continuous variables\\nwhere some of these message length interpretations do not apply. This ï¬eld is\\nfundamental to many areas of electrical engineering and computer science. In this\\ntextbook, we mostly use a few key ideas from information theory to characterize\\nprobability distributions or quantify similarity between probability distributions.\\nFor more detail on information theory, see Cover and Thomas (2006) or MacKay\\n(2003).\\n\\nThe basic intuition behind information theory is that learning that an unlikely\\nevent has occurred is more informative than learning that a likely event has\\noccurred. A message saying âthe sun rose this morningâ is so uninformative as\\nto be unnecessary to send, but a message saying âthere was a solar eclipse this\\nmorningâ is very informative.\\n\\nWe would like to quantify information in a way that formalizes this intuition.\\n\\nSpeciï¬cally,\\n\\nâ¢ Likely events should have low information content, and in the extreme case,\\nevents that are guaranteed to happen should have no information content\\nwhatsoever.\\n\\nâ¢ Less likely events should have higher information content.\\nâ¢ Independent events should have additive information. For example, ï¬nding\\nout that a tossed coin has come up as heads twice should convey twice as\\nmuch information as ï¬nding out that a tossed coin has come up as heads\\nonce.\\n\\nIn order to satisfy all three of these properties, we deï¬ne the self-information\\n\\nof an event x\\n\\n= x\\n\\nto be\\n\\nI x\\n( ) = \\n\\nlogâ\\n\\nP x .\\n( )\\n\\n(3.48)\\n\\nIn this book, we always use log to mean the natural logarithm, with base e. Our\\ndeï¬nition of I(x) is therefore written in units of\\n. One nat is the amount of\\ninformation gained by observing an event of probability 1\\ne . Other texts use base-2\\nlogarithms and units called\\nshannons\\n; information measured in bits is just\\na rescaling of information measured in nats.\\n\\nnats\\n\\nbits\\n\\nor\\n\\nWhen x is continuous, we use the same deï¬nition of information by analogy,\\nbut some of the properties from the discrete case are lost. For example, an event\\nwith unit density still has zero information, despite not being an event that is\\nguaranteed to occur.\\n\\n72\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3.

The entropy is given by\\nlog . When p is near 0, the distribution\\nis nearly deterministic, because the random variable is nearly always 0. When p is near 1,\\nthe distribution is nearly deterministic, because the random variable is nearly always 1.\\nWhen p = 0 .5, the entropy is maximal, because the distribution is uniform over the two\\noutcomes.\\n\\n(pâ 1) log(1â p )â p\\n\\np\\n\\nSelf-information deals only with a single outcome.

In other words, the Shannon entropy of a distribution is the\\nexpected amount of information in an event drawn from that distribution. It gives\\na lower bound on the number of bits (if the logarithm is base 2, otherwise the units\\nare diï¬erent) needed on average to encode symbols drawn from a distribution P.\\nDistributions that are nearly deterministic (where the outcome is nearly certain)\\nhave low entropy; distributions that are closer to uniform have high entropy. See\\nFig. 3.5 for a demonstration. When x is continous, the Shannon entropy is known\\nas the diï¬erential entropy.\\n\\nIf we have two separate probability distributions P(x) and Q(x) over the same\\nrandom variable x, we can measure how diï¬erent these two distributions are using\\nthe Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence:\\n\\nDKL(\\n\\nP Q\\ue06b\\n\\n) = \\n\\nE xâ¼P\\ue014log\\n\\nP x( )\\n\\nQ x( )\\ue015 = Exâ¼P [log ( )\\n\\nP x â\\n\\n73\\n\\nlog ( )]\\nQ x .\\n\\n(3.50)\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nIn the case of discrete variables, it is the extra amount of information (measured\\nin bits if we use the base\\nlogarithm, but in machine learning we usually use nats\\nand the natural logarithm) needed to send a message containing symbols drawn\\nfrom probability distribution P , when we use a code that was designed to minimize\\nthe length of messages drawn from probability distribution\\n\\n.Q\\n\\n2\\n\\nThe KL divergence has many useful properties, most notably that it is non-\\nnegative. The KL divergence is 0 if and only if P and Qare the same distribution in\\nthe case of discrete variables, or equal âalmost everywhereâ in the case of continuous\\nvariables. Because the KL divergence is non-negative and measures the diï¬erence\\nbetween two distributions, it is often conceptualized as measuring some sort of\\ndistance between these distributions. However, it is not a true distance measure\\nbecause it is not symmetric: DKL(P Q\\ue06b ) \\ue036= DKL( Q P\\ue06b ) for some P and Q. This\\nasymmetry means that there are important consequences to the choice of whether\\nto use DKL(\\n\\n. See Fig. 3.6 for more detail.\\n\\nor DKL (\\n\\n)\\n\\nP Q\\ue06b\\n\\n)Q P\\ue06b\\n\\nA quantity that is closely related to the KL divergence is the cross-entropy\\nH (P, Q ) = H (P) + DKL(P Q\\ue06b ), which is similar to the KL divergence but lacking\\nthe term on the left:\\n(3.51)\\n\\nH P, Q(\\n\\n) = âE\\n\\nxâ¼P log ( )Q x .\\n\\nMinimizing the cross-entropy with respect to Q is equivalent to minimizing the\\nKL divergence, because\\n\\ndoes not participate in the omitted term.\\n\\nQ\\n\\nWhen computing many of these quantities, it is common to encounter expres-\\nsions of the form 0log 0.

Often, these probability distributions involve\\ndirect interactions between relatively few variables. Using a single function to\\ndescribe the entire joint probability distribution can be very ineï¬cient (both\\ncomputationally and statistically).\\n\\nInstead of using a single function to represent a probability distribution, we\\ncan split a probability distribution into many factors that we multiply together.\\nFor example, suppose we have three random variables: a, b and c . Suppose that\\na inï¬uences the value of b and b inï¬uences the value of c, but that a and c are\\nindependent given b. We can represent the probability distribution over all three\\n\\n74\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3.

Suppose we have a distribution p(x ) and\\nwish to approximate it with another distribution q(x). We have the choice of minimizing\\neither DKL( p q\\ue06b ) or DKL( q p\\ue06b ). We illustrate the eï¬ect of this choice using a mixture of\\ntwo Gaussians for p, and a single Gaussian for q. The choice of which direction of the\\nKL divergence to use is problem-dependent. Some applications require an approximation\\nthat usually places high probability anywhere that the true distribution places high\\nprobability, while other applications require an approximation that rarely places high\\nprobability anywhere that the true distribution places low probability. The choice of the\\ndirection of the KL divergence reï¬ects which of these considerations takes priority for each\\napplication. (Left) The eï¬ect of minimizing DKL (p q\\ue06b ). In this case, we select a q that has\\nhigh probability where p has high probability. When p has multiple modes, q chooses to\\nblur the modes together, in order to put high probability mass on all of them. (Right) The\\neï¬ect of minimizing DKL (q p\\ue06b ). In this case, we select a q that has low probability where\\np has low probability. When p has multiple modes that are suï¬ciently widely separated,\\nas in this ï¬gure, the KL divergence is minimized by choosing a single mode, in order to\\navoid putting probability mass in the low-probability areas between modes of p . Here, we\\nillustrate the outcome when q is chosen to emphasize the left mode. We could also have\\nachieved an equal value of the KL divergence by choosing the right mode. If the modes\\nare not separated by a suï¬ciently strong low probability region, then this direction of the\\nKL divergence can still choose to blur the modes.\\n\\n75\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3.

Each factor uses a number of parameters that is\\nexponential in the number of variables in the factor. This means that we can greatly\\nreduce the cost of representing a distribution if we are able to ï¬nd a factorization\\ninto distributions over fewer variables.\\n\\nWe can describe these kinds of factorizations using graphs. Here we use the\\nword âgraphâ in the sense of graph theory: a set of vertices that may be connected\\nto each other with edges. When we represent the factorization of a probability\\ndistribution with a graph, we call it a structured probabilistic model\\ngraphical\\nmodel.\\n\\nor\\n\\nThere are two main kinds of structured probabilistic models: directed and\\nundirected. Both kinds of graphical models use a graph G in which each node\\nin the graph corresponds to a random variable, and an edge connecting two\\nrandom variables means that the probability distribution is able to represent direct\\ninteractions between those two random variables.\\n\\nDirected models use graphs with directed edges, and they represent factoriza-\\ntions into conditional probability distributions, as in the example above. Speciï¬cally,\\na directed model contains one factor for every random variable x i in the distribution,\\nand that factor consists of the conditional distribution over xi given the parents of\\nxi, denoted P a G(x i):\\n\\n(3.53)\\n\\np( ) =x \\ue059i\\n\\np (xi | P aG (xi )) .\\n\\nSee Fig. 3.7 for an example of a directed graph and the factorization of probability\\ndistributions it represents.\\n\\nUndirected models use graphs with undirected edges, and they represent fac-\\ntorizations into a set of functions; unlike in the directed case, these functions are\\nusually not probability distributions of any kind. Any set of nodes that are all\\nconnected to each other in G is called a clique. Each clique C ( )i\\nin an undirected\\nmodel is associated with a factor Ï( )i (C ( )i ). These factors are just functions, not\\nprobability distributions. The output of each factor must be non-negative, but\\nthere is no constraint that the factor must sum or integrate to 1 like a probability\\ndistribution.\\n\\nThe probability of a conï¬guration of random variables is proportional to the\\nproduct of all of these factorsâassignments that result in larger factor values are\\n\\n76\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3.

      "\n",
      "Many branches of computer science deal mostly with entities that are entirely\n",
      "deterministic and certain. A programmer can usually safely assume that a CPU will\n",
      "execute each machine instruction ï¬awlessly. Errors in hardware do occur, but are\n",
      "rare enough that most software applications do not need to be designed to account\n",
      "for them. Given that many computer scientists and software engineers work in a\n",
      "relatively clean and certain environment, it can be surprising that machine learning\n",
      "makes heavy use of probability theory.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is because machine learning must always deal with uncertain quantities,\n",
      "and sometimes may also need to deal with stochastic (non-deterministic) quantities.\n",
      "Uncertainty and stochasticity can arise from many sources. Researchers have made\n",
      "compelling arguments for quantifying uncertainty using probability since at least\n",
      "the 1980s. Many of the arguments presented here are summarized from or inspired\n",
      "by Pearl (1988).\n",
      "\n",
      "Nearly all activities require some ability to reason in the presence of uncertainty.\n",
      "In fact, beyond mathematical statements that are true by deï¬nition, it is diï¬cult\n",
      "to think of any proposition that is absolutely true or any event that is absolutely\n",
      "guaranteed to occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are three possible sources of uncertainty:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Inherent stochasticity in the system being modeled. For example, most\n",
      "interpretations of quantum mechanics describe the dynamics of subatomic\n",
      "particles as being probabilistic. We can also create theoretical scenarios that\n",
      "we postulate to have random dynamics, such as a hypothetical card game\n",
      "where we assume that the cards are truly shuï¬ed into a random order.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Incomplete observability. Even deterministic systems can appear stochastic\n",
      "when we cannot observe all of the variables that drive the behavior of the\n",
      "system. For example, in the Monty Hall problem, a game show contestant is\n",
      "asked to choose between three doors and wins a prize held behind the chosen\n",
      "door. Two doors lead to a goat while a third leads to a car. The outcome\n",
      "given the contestantâs choice is deterministic, but from the contestantâs point\n",
      "of view, the outcome is uncertain.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Incomplete modeling. When we use a model that must discard some of\n",
      "the information we have observed, the discarded information results in\n",
      "uncertainty in the modelâs predictions. For example, suppose we build a\n",
      "robot that can exactly observe the location of every object around it. If the\n",

      "robot discretizes space when predicting the future location of these objects,\n",
      "then the discretization makes the robot immediately become uncertain about\n",
      "the precise position of objects: each object could be anywhere within the\n",
      "discrete cell that it was observed to occupy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In many cases, it is more practical to use a simple but uncertain rule rather\n",
      "than a complex but certain one, even if the true rule is deterministic and our\n",
      "modeling system has the ï¬delity to accommodate a complex rule. For example, the\n",

      "communicate, and after all of this eï¬ort is still very brittle and prone to failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that we need a means of representing and reasoning about uncertainty,\n",
      "it is not immediately obvious that probability theory can provide all of the tools\n",
      "we want for artiï¬cial intelligence applications. Probability theory was originally\n",
      "developed to analyze the frequencies of events. It is easy to see how probability\n",
      "theory can be used to study events like drawing a certain hand of cards in a\n",
      "game of poker. These kinds of events are often repeatable. When we say that\n",
      "an outcome has a probability p of occurring, it means that if we repeated the\n",
      "experiment (e.g., draw a hand of cards) inï¬nitely many times, then proportion p\n",
      "of the repetitions would result in that outcome. This kind of reasoning does not\n",
      "seem immediately applicable to propositions that are not repeatable. If a doctor\n",
      "analyzes a patient and says that the patient has a 40% chance of having the ï¬u,\n",
      "this means something very diï¬erentâwe can not make inï¬nitely many replicas of\n",

      "would present with the same symptoms yet have varying underlying conditions. In\n",

      "degree of belief, with 1 indicating absolute certainty that the patient has the ï¬u\n",

      "In Sec. 3.3.2, we saw that the probability of a continuous vector-valued x lying\n",
      "in some set S is given by the integral of p(x ) over the set S. Some choices of set S\n",
      "can produce paradoxes. For example, it is possible to construct two sets S1 and\n",

      "of without encountering paradoxes. In this book, we only integrate over sets with\n",
      "relatively simple descriptions, so this aspect of measure theory never becomes a\n",

      "For our purposes, measure theory is more useful for describing theorems that\n",
      "apply to most points in Rn but do not apply to some corner cases. Measure theory\n",
      "provides a rigorous way of describing that a set of points is negligibly small. Such\n",
      "a set is said to have âmeasure zero.â We do not formally deï¬ne this concept in this\n",

      "has measure zero, for instance).\n",

       "'Chapter 3\\n\\nProbability and Information\\nTheory\\n\\nIn this chapter, we describe probability theory and information theory.\\n\\nProbability theory is a mathematical framework for representing uncertain\\nstatements. It provides a means of quantifying uncertainty and axioms for deriving\\nnew uncertain statements. In artiï¬cial intelligence applications, we use probability\\ntheory in two major ways. First, the laws of probability tell us how AI systems\\nshould reason, so we design our algorithms to compute or approximate various\\nexpressions derived using probability theory. Second, we can use probability and\\nstatistics to theoretically analyze the behavior of proposed AI systems.\\n\\nProbability theory is a fundamental tool of many disciplines of science and\\nengineering. We provide this chapter to ensure that readers whose background is\\nprimarily in software engineering with limited exposure to probability theory can\\nunderstand the material in this book.\\n\\nWhile probability theory allows us to make uncertain statements and reason\\nin the presence of uncertainty, information allows us to quantify the amount of\\nuncertainty in a probability distribution.\\n\\nIf you are already familiar with probability theory and information theory,\\nyou may wish to skip all of this chapter except for Sec. 3.14, which describes the\\ngraphs we use to describe structured probabilistic models for machine learning. If\\nyou have absolutely no prior experience with these subjects, this chapter should\\nbe suï¬cient to successfully carry out deep learning research projects, but we do\\nsuggest that you consult an additional resource, such as Jaynes (2003).\\n\\n52\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\n3.1 Why Probability?\\n\\nMany branches of computer science deal mostly with entities that are entirely\\ndeterministic and certain. A programmer can usually safely assume that a CPU will\\nexecute each machine instruction ï¬awlessly. Errors in hardware do occur, but are\\nrare enough that most software applications do not need to be designed to account\\nfor them. Given that many computer scientists and software engineers work in a\\nrelatively clean and certain environment, it can be surprising that machine learning\\nmakes heavy use of probability theory.\\n\\nThis is because machine learning must always deal with uncertain quantities,\\nand sometimes may also need to deal with stochastic (non-deterministic) quantities.\\nUncertainty and stochasticity can arise from many sources. Researchers have made\\ncompelling arguments for quantifying uncertainty using probability since at least\\nthe 1980s. Many of the arguments presented here are summarized from or inspired\\nby Pearl (1988).\\n\\nNearly all activities require some ability to reason in the presence of uncertainty.\\nIn fact, beyond mathematical statements that are true by deï¬nition, it is diï¬cult\\nto think of any proposition that is absolutely true or any event that is absolutely\\nguaranteed to occur.\\n\\nThere are three possible sources of uncertainty:\\n\\n1. Inherent stochasticity in the system being modeled. For example, most\\ninterpretations of quantum mechanics describe the dynamics of subatomic\\nparticles as being probabilistic. We can also create theoretical scenarios that\\nwe postulate to have random dynamics, such as a hypothetical card game\\nwhere we assume that the cards are truly shuï¬ed into a random order.\\n\\n2. Incomplete observability. Even deterministic systems can appear stochastic\\nwhen we cannot observe all of the variables that drive the behavior of the\\nsystem. For example, in the Monty Hall problem, a game show contestant is\\nasked to choose between three doors and wins a prize held behind the chosen\\ndoor. Two doors lead to a goat while a third leads to a car. The outcome\\ngiven the contestantâs choice is deterministic, but from the contestantâs point\\nof view, the outcome is uncertain.\\n\\n3. Incomplete modeling. When we use a model that must discard some of\\nthe information we have observed, the discarded information results in\\nuncertainty in the modelâs predictions. For example, suppose we build a\\nrobot that can exactly observe the location of every object around it. If the\\n\\n53\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nrobot discretizes space when predicting the future location of these objects,\\nthen the discretization makes the robot immediately become uncertain about\\nthe precise position of objects: each object could be anywhere within the\\ndiscrete cell that it was observed to occupy.\\n\\nIn many cases, it is more practical to use a simple but uncertain rule rather\\nthan a complex but certain one, even if the true rule is deterministic and our\\nmodeling system has the ï¬delity to accommodate a complex rule. For example, the\\nsimple rule âMost birds ï¬yâ is cheap to develop and is broadly useful, while a rule\\nof the form, âBirds ï¬y, except for very young birds that have not yet learned to\\nï¬y, sick or injured birds that have lost the ability to ï¬y, ï¬ightless species of birds\\nincluding the cassowary, ostrich and kiwi. . . â is expensive to develop, maintain and\\ncommunicate, and after all of this eï¬ort is still very brittle and prone to failure.\\n\\nGiven that we need a means of representing and reasoning about uncertainty,\\nit is not immediately obvious that probability theory can provide all of the tools\\nwe want for artiï¬cial intelligence applications. Probability theory was originally\\ndeveloped to analyze the frequencies of events. It is easy to see how probability\\ntheory can be used to study events like drawing a certain hand of cards in a\\ngame of poker. These kinds of events are often repeatable. When we say that\\nan outcome has a probability p of occurring, it means that if we repeated the\\nexperiment (e.g., draw a hand of cards) inï¬nitely many times, then proportion p\\nof the repetitions would result in that outcome. This kind of reasoning does not\\nseem immediately applicable to propositions that are not repeatable. If a doctor\\nanalyzes a patient and says that the patient has a 40% chance of having the ï¬u,\\nthis means something very diï¬erentâwe can not make inï¬nitely many replicas of\\nthe patient, nor is there any reason to believe that diï¬erent replicas of the patient\\nwould present with the same symptoms yet have varying underlying conditions. In\\nthe case of the doctor diagnosing the patient, we use probability to represent a\\ndegree of belief, with 1 indicating absolute certainty that the patient has the ï¬u\\nand 0 indicating absolute certainty that the patient does not have the ï¬u. The\\nformer kind of probability, related directly to the rates at which events occur, is\\nknown as frequentist probability, while the latter, related to qualitative levels of\\ncertainty, is known as Bayesian probability.\\n\\nIf we list several properties that we expect common sense reasoning about\\nuncertainty to have, then the only way to satisfy those properties is to treat\\nBayesian probabilities as behaving exactly the same as frequentist probabilities.\\nFor example, if we want to compute the probability that a player will win a poker\\ngame given that she has a certain set of cards, we use exactly the same formulas\\nas when we compute the probability that a patient has a disease given that she\\n\\n54\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3.

For more details about why a small set of common sense\\nassumptions implies that the same axioms must control both kinds of probability,\\nsee Ramsey (1926).\\n\\nProbability can be seen as the extension of logic to deal with uncertainty. Logic\\nprovides a set of formal rules for determining what propositions are implied to\\nbe true or false given the assumption that some other set of propositions is true\\nor false. Probability theory provides a set of formal rules for determining the\\nlikelihood of a proposition being true given the likelihood of other propositions.\\n\\n3.2 Random Variables\\n\\nA random variable is a variable that can take on diï¬erent values randomly. We\\ntypically denote the random variable itself with a lower case letter in plain typeface,\\nand the values it can take on with lower case script letters. For example, x1 and x2\\nare both possible values that the random variable x can take on. For vector-valued\\nvariables, we would write the random variable as x and one of its values as x. On\\nits own, a random variable is just a description of the states that are possible; it\\nmust be coupled with a probability distribution that speciï¬es how likely each of\\nthese states are.\\n\\nRandom variables may be discrete or continuous. A discrete random variable\\nis one that has a ï¬nite or countably inï¬nite number of states. Note that these\\nstates are not necessarily the integers; they can also just be named states that\\nare not considered to have any numerical value. A continuous random variable is\\nassociated with a real value.\\n\\n3.3 Probability Distributions\\n\\nA probability distribution is a description of how likely a random variable or\\nset of random variables is to take on each of its possible states. The way we\\ndescribe probability distributions depends on whether the variables are discrete or\\ncontinuous.\\n\\n3.3.1 Discrete Variables and Probability Mass Functions\\n\\nA probability distribution over discrete variables may be described using a proba-\\nbility mass function (PMF). We typically denote probability mass functions with a\\ncapital P . Often we associate each random variable with a diï¬erent probability\\n\\n55\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nmass function and the reader must infer which probability mass function to use\\nbased on the identity of the random variable, rather than the name of the function;\\nP\\n\\n( )x is usually not the same as\\n\\n( )y .\\n\\nP\\n\\nThe probability mass function maps from a state of a random variable to\\nthe probability of that random variable taking on that state. The probability\\nthat x = x is denoted as P (x), with a probability of 1 indicating that x = x is\\ncertain and a probability of 0 indicating that x = x is impossible. Sometimes\\nto disambiguate which PMF to use, we write the name of the random variable\\nexplicitly: P (x = x). Sometimes we deï¬ne a variable ï¬rst, then use â¼ notation to\\nspecify which distribution it follows later: x â¼ P (x .)\\n\\nProbability mass functions can act on many variables at the same time. Such\\na probability distribution over many variables is known as a joint probability\\ndistribution. P (x = x, y = y) denotes the probability that x = x and y = y\\nsimultaneously. We may also write\\n\\nfor brevity.\\n\\nP x, y\\n\\n(\\n\\n)\\n\\nTo be a probability mass function on a random variable x, a function P must\\n\\nsatisfy the following properties:\\n\\nP\\n\\nâ¢ The domain of must be the set of all possible states of x.\\nâ¢ âx\\n0 \\n\\n,â x 0 â¤ P (x) â¤ 1. An impossible event has probability and no state can\\nbe less probable than that. Likewise, an event that is guaranteed to happen\\nhas probability , and no state can have a greater chance of occurring.\\n\\n1\\n\\nâ¢ \\ue050xâx P (x) = 1. We refer to this property as being normalized. Without this\\n\\nproperty, we could obtain probabilities greater than one by computing the\\nprobability of one of many events occurring.\\n\\nFor example, consider a single discrete random variable x with k diï¬erent states.\\nxâthat is, make each of its states equally\\n\\nuniform distribution\\n\\nWe can place a\\nlikelyâby setting its probability mass function to\\n\\non\\n\\nP\\n\\n( = x\\n\\nx\\ni) =\\n\\n1\\nk\\n\\n(3.1)\\n\\nfor all i.

PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\n3.3.2 Continuous Variables and Probability Density Functions\\n\\nWhen working with continuous random variables, we describe probability dis-\\ntributions using a probability density function (PDF) rather than a probability\\nmass function. To be a probability density function, a function p must satisfy the\\nfollowing properties:\\n\\np\\n\\nâ¢ The domain of must be the set of all possible states of x.\\nâ¢ âx\\n\\n0â¥ Note that we do not require ( ) \\np x\\n\\n1â¤ .\\n\\n.\\n\\nâ x ( ) \\n, p x\\n( ) = 1.\\n\\nâ¢ \\ue052 p x dx\\n\\nA probability density function p(x) does not give the probability of a speciï¬c\\nstate directly, instead the probability of landing inside an inï¬nitesimal region with\\nvolume\\n\\nis given by\\n\\np x Î´x\\n\\n( )\\n\\nÎ´x\\n\\n.\\n\\nWe can integrate the density function to ï¬nd the actual probability mass of a\\nset of points. Speciï¬cally, the probability that x lies in some set S is given by the\\nintegral of p(x) over that set. In the univariate example, the probability that x\\nlies in the interval\\n\\nis given by\\n\\n.\\np x dx\\n\\n[\\n]a, b\\n\\n( )\\n\\nFor an example of a probability density function corresponding to a speciï¬c\\nprobability density over a continuous random variable, consider a uniform distribu-\\ntion on an interval of the real numbers. We can do this with a function u (x; a, b),\\nwhere a and b are the endpoints of the interval, with b > a. The â;â notation means\\nâparametrized byâ; we consider x to be the argument of the function, while a and\\nb are parameters that deï¬ne the function. To ensure that there is no probability\\nmass outside the interval, we say u(x; a, b) = 0 for all x \\ue036â [a, b]\\n. Within a, b],\\n. We can see that this is nonnegative everywhere. Additionally, it\\nu x a, b\\n( ;\\nintegrates to 1.

The probability\\ndistribution over the subset is known as the marginal probability distribution.\\n\\nFor example, suppose we have discrete random variables x and y , and we know\\n\\nP ,(x y .

PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nThe name âmarginal probabilityâ comes from the process of computing marginal\\nprobabilities on paper. When the values of P(x y, ) are written in a grid with\\ndiï¬erent values of x in rows and diï¬erent values of y in columns, it is natural to\\nsum across a row of the grid, then write P( x) in the margin of the paper just to\\nthe right of the row.\\n\\nFor continuous variables, we need to use integration instead of summation:\\n\\np x( ) =\\ue05a p x, y dy.\\n\\n(\\n\\n)\\n\\n(3.4)\\n\\n3.5 Conditional Probability\\n\\nIn many cases, we are interested in the probability of some event, given that some\\nother event has happened. This is called a conditional probability. We denote\\nthe conditional probability that y = y given x = x as P (y = y | x = x ). This\\nconditional probability can be computed with the formula\\n\\nP\\n\\n( = y\\n\\ny\\n\\n| x =  ) =\\n\\nx\\n\\nP\\n\\n( = y\\n\\ny,\\n\\nx =  )\\nx\\nx\\n)\\n\\nP\\n\\n( = x\\n\\n.\\n\\n(3.5)\\n\\nThe conditional probability is only deï¬ned when P (x = x) > 0. We cannot compute\\nthe conditional probability conditioned on an event that never happens.\\n\\nIt is important not to confuse conditional probability with computing what\\nwould happen if some action were undertaken. The conditional probability that\\na person is from Germany given that they speak German is quite high, but if\\na randomly selected person is taught to speak German, their country of origin\\ndoes not change. Computing the consequences of an action is called making an\\nintervention query. Intervention queries are the domain of causal modeling, which\\nwe do not explore in this book.\\n\\n3.6 The Chain Rule of Conditional Probabilities\\n\\nAny joint probability distribution over many random variables may be decomposed\\ninto conditional distributions over only one variable:\\n\\nP (x(1), . . . , x ( )n ) = \\n\\n| x(1), . . . , x (\\nproduct rule of probability.

For discrete variables this can be computed with a summation:\\n\\nexpected value\\n\\nP\\n\\nExâ¼P[ (f x)] =\\ue058x\\n\\nP x f x ,\\n( ) ( )\\n\\n(3.9)\\n\\nwhile for continuous variables, it is computed with an integral:\\n\\nExâ¼p[ ( )] =\\n\\nf x\\n\\n\\ue05a p x f x dx.\\n\\n( ) ( )\\n\\n59\\n\\n(3.10)\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nWhen the identity of the distribution is clear from the context, we may simply\\nwrite the name of the random variable that the expectation is over, as in Ex[f (x)].\\nIf it is clear which random variable the expectation is over, we may omit the\\nsubscript entirely, as in E[f (x)]. By default, we can assume that E [Â·] averages over\\nthe values of all the random variables inside the brackets. Likewise, when there is\\nno ambiguity, we may omit the square brackets.\\n\\nExpectations are linear, for example,\\n\\nE x[\\n\\nÎ±f x\\n\\n( ) + ( )] = \\n\\nÎ²g x\\n\\nÎ±Ex [ ( )] +\\n\\nf x\\n\\nÎ²Ex[ ( )]\\ng x ,\\n\\n(3.11)\\n\\nwhen\\n\\nÎ±\\n\\nand\\n\\nÎ²\\n\\nare not dependent on .\\nx\\n\\nThe variance gives a measure of how much the values of a function of a random\\nvariable x vary as we sample diï¬erent value of x from its probability distribution:\\n\\nVar( ( )) = \\n\\nf x\\n\\nE\\ue068( ( )\\nf x â E f x 2\\ue069.\\n\\n[ ( )])\\n\\n(3.12)\\n\\nWhen the variance is low, the values of f (x) cluster near their expected value. The\\nsquare root of the variance is known as the standard deviation.\\n\\nThe covariance gives some sense of how much two values are linearly related to\\n\\neach other, as well as the scale of these variables:\\n\\nCov( ( )\\n\\nf x , g y\\n\\n( )) = \\n\\nE f x â E f x\\n[( ( )\\n\\n[ ( )]) ( ( )\\n\\ng y â E g y\\n\\n[ ( )])]\\n\\n.\\n\\n(3.13)\\n\\nHigh absolute values of the covariance mean that the values change very much\\nand are both far from their respective means at the same time. If the sign of the\\ncovariance is positive, then both variables tend to take on relatively high values\\nsimultaneously. If the sign of the covariance is negative, then one variable tends to\\ntake on a relatively high value at the times that the other takes on a relatively low\\nvalue and vice versa. Other measures such as correlation normalize the contribution\\nof each variable in order to measure only how much the variables are related, rather\\nthan also being aï¬ected by the scale of the separate variables.\\n\\nThe notions of covariance and dependence are related, but are in fact distinct\\nconcepts. They are related because two variables that are independent have zero\\ncovariance, and two variables that have non-zero covariance are dependent. How-\\never, independence is a distinct property from covariance. For two variables to have\\nzero covariance, there must be no linear dependence between them. Independence\\nis a stronger requirement than zero covariance, because independence also excludes\\nnonlinear relationships. It is possible for two variables to be dependent but have\\nzero covariance. For example, suppose we ï¬rst sample a real number x from a\\nuniform distribution over the interval [â1 ,1]. We next sample a random variable\\n\\n60\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\ns. With probability 1\\n2, we choose the value of s to be 1. Otherwise, we choose\\nthe value of s to be â 1. We can then generate a random variable y by assigning\\ny = sx .

The multinoulli distribution is\\n\\nor\\n\\n1 âMultinoulliâ is a term that was recently coined by Gustavo Lacerdo and popularized by\\nMurphy (2012). The multinoulli distribution is a special case of the\\ndistribution. A\\nmultinomial distribution is the distribution over vectors in {0, . . . , n}k representing how many\\ntimes each of the k categories is visited when n samples are drawn from a multinoulli distribution.\\nMany texts use the term âmultinomialâ to refer to multinoulli distributions without clarifying\\nthat they refer only to the\\n\\nmultinomial\\n\\nn = 1\\n\\ncase.\\n\\n61\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3.

The ï¬nal, k-th stateâs probability is given by 1â 1\\ue03e p. Note that we must\\nconstrain 1 \\ue03ep â¤ 1. Multinoulli distributions are often used to refer to distributions\\nover categories of objects, so we do not usually assume that state 1 has numerical\\nvalue 1, etc. For this reason, we do not usually need to compute the expectation\\nor variance of multinoulli-distributed random variables.\\n\\nThe Bernoulli and multinoulli distributions are suï¬cient to describe any distri-\\nbution over their domain. This is because they model discrete variables for which\\nit is feasible to simply enumerate all of the states. When dealing with continuous\\nvariables, there are uncountably many states, so any distribution described by a\\nsmall number of parameters must impose strict limits on the distribution.\\n\\n3.9.3 Gaussian Distribution\\n\\nThe most commonly used distribution over real numbers is the normal distribution,\\nalso known as the Gaussian distribution:\\n\\nN ( ;x Âµ, Ï2) =\\ue072 1\\n\\n2ÏÏ2 exp\\ue012â\\n\\n1\\nx\\n2Ï2 (\\n\\nÂµâ 2\\ue013 .\\n\\n)\\n\\n(3.21)\\n\\nSee Fig. 3.1 for a plot of the density function.\\nThe two parameters Âµ â R and Ï â (0,â ) control the normal distribution.\\nThe parameter Âµ gives the coordinate of the central peak. This is also the mean of\\nthe distribution: E[x] = Âµ. The standard deviation of the distribution is given by\\nÏ, and the variance by Ï2.\\n\\nWhen we evaluate the PDF, we need to square and invert Ï. When we need to\\nfrequently evaluate the PDF with diï¬erent parameter values, a more eï¬cient way\\nof parametrizing the distribution is to use a parameter Î² â (0 ,â) to control the\\nprecision or inverse variance of the distribution:\\n\\nN ( ;x Âµ, Î²â1) =\\ue072 Î²\\n\\n2Ï\\n\\nexp\\ue012â\\n\\n1\\n2\\n\\nÎ² x\\n\\n( â )2\\ue013 .\\n\\nÂµ\\n\\n(3.22)\\n\\nNormal distributions are a sensible choice for many applications. In the absence\\nof prior knowledge about what form a distribution over the real numbers should\\ntake, the normal distribution is a good default choice for two major reasons.\\n\\nFirst, many distributions we wish to model are truly close to being normal\\ndistributions. The central limit theorem shows that the sum of many independent\\nrandom variables is approximately normally distributed. This means that in\\n\\n62\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3.

We can thus think of the normal distribution as being the one that\\ninserts the least amount of prior knowledge into a model. Fully developing and\\njustifying this idea requires more mathematical tools, and is postponed to Sec.\\n19.4.2.\\n\\nThe normal distribution generalizes to Rn, in which case it is known as the\\nmultivariate normal distribution.

The Dirac delta function is not an ordinary function that\\nassociates each value x with a real-valued output, instead it is a diï¬erent kind of\\nmathematical object called a generalized function that is deï¬ned in terms of its\\nproperties when integrated. We can think of the Dirac delta function as being the\\nlimit point of a series of functions that put less and less mass on all points other\\nthan .Âµ\\n\\n64\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nBy deï¬ning p(x) to be Î´ shifted by âÂµ we obtain an inï¬nitely narrow and\\n\\ninï¬nitely high peak of probability mass where\\n\\nx\\n\\nÂµ= \\n\\n.\\n\\nA common use of the Dirac delta distribution is as a component of an empirical\\n\\ndistribution,\\n\\nËp( ) =x\\n\\n1\\nm\\n\\nm\\ue058i=1\\n\\nÎ´(x xâ ( )i )\\n\\n(3.28)\\n\\n1\\nm on each of the m points x(1), . . . , x (\\n\\n)m forming\\nwhich puts probability mass\\na given data set or collection of samples. The Dirac delta distribution is only\\nnecessary to deï¬ne the empirical distribution over continuous variables. For discrete\\nvariables, the situation is simpler: an empirical distribution can be conceptualized\\nas a multinoulli distribution, with a probability associated to each possible input\\nvalue that is simply equal to the empirical frequency of that value in the training\\nset.\\n\\nWe can view the empirical distribution formed from a dataset of training\\nexamples as specifying the distribution that we sample from when we train a model\\non this dataset. Another important perspective on the empirical distribution is\\nthat it is the probability density that maximizes the likelihood of the training\\ndata (see Sec. 5.5). Many machine learning algorithms can be conï¬gured to have\\narbitrarily high capacity. If given enough capacity, these algorithms will simply\\nlearn the empirical distribution. This is a bad outcome because the model does not\\ngeneralize at all and assigns inï¬nitesimal probability to any point in space that did\\nnot occur in the training set. A central problem in machine learning is studying\\nhow to limit the capacity of a model in a way that prevents it from simply learning\\nthe empirical distribution while also allowing it to learn complicated functions.\\n\\n3.9.6 Mixtures of Distributions\\n\\nIt is also common to deï¬ne probability distributions by combining other simpler\\nprobability distributions. One common way of combining distributions is to\\nconstruct a mixture distribution. A mixture distribution is made up of several\\ncomponent distributions. On each trial, the choice of which component distribution\\ngenerates the sample is determined by sampling a component identity from a\\nmultinoulli distribution:\\n\\nP ( ) =x \\ue058i\\n\\nP\\n\\nc\\n( = \\n\\ni P\\n)\\n\\nx c|\\n(\\n\\n=\\n\\ni\\n)\\n\\n(3.29)\\n\\nwhere\\n\\nP ( )\\n\\nc is the multinoulli distribution over component identities.\\n\\n65\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nWe have already seen one example of a mixture distribution: the empirical\\ndistribution over real-valued variables is a mixture distribution with one Dirac\\ncomponent for each training example.\\n\\nThe mixture model is one simple strategy for combining probability distributions\\nto create a richer distribution. In Chapter 16, we explore the art of building complex\\nprobability distributions from simple ones in more detail.\\n\\nlatent variable\\n\\nThe mixture model allows us to brieï¬y glimpse a concept that will be of\\nparamount importance laterâthe\\n. A latent variable is a random\\nvariable that we cannot observe directly. The component identity variable c of the\\nmixture model provides an example. Latent variables may be related to x through\\nthe joint distribution, in this case, P (x c, ) = P (x c|\\n)P(c). The distribution P (c)\\nover the latent variable and the distribution P (x c| ) relating the latent variables\\nto the visible variables determines the shape of the distribution P ( x) even though\\nit is possible to describe P (x) without reference to the latent variable. Latent\\nvariables are discussed further in Sec. 16.5.\\n\\nA very powerful and common type of mixture model is the Gaussian mixture\\nmodel, in which the components p (x | c = i) are Gaussians. Each component has\\na separately parametrized mean Âµ ( )i and covariance Î£ ( )i . Some mixtures can have\\nmore constraints. For example, the covariances could be shared across components\\nvia the constraint Î£( )i = Î£âi. As with a single Gaussian distribution, the mixture\\nof Gaussians might constrain the covariance matrix for each component to be\\ndiagonal or isotropic.\\n\\nIn addition to the means and covariances, the parameters of a Gaussian mixture\\nspecify the prior probability Î± i = P (c = i) given to each component i. The word\\nâpriorâ indicates that it expresses the modelâs beliefs about c before it has observed\\nx. By comparison, P(c | x) is a posterior probability, because it is computed after\\nobservation of x. A Gaussian mixture model is a universal approximator of\\ndensities, in the sense that any smooth density can be approximated with any\\nspeciï¬c, non-zero amount of error by a Gaussian mixture model with enough\\ncomponents.\\n\\nFig. 3.2 shows samples from a Gaussian mixture model.\\n\\n3.10 Useful Properties of Common Functions\\n\\nCertain functions arise often while working with probability distributions, especially\\nthe probability distributions used in deep learning models.\\n\\n66\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\n2\\nx\\n\\nx1\\n\\nFigure 3.2: Samples from a Gaussian mixture model. In this example, there are three\\ncomponents. From left to right, the ï¬rst component has an isotropic covariance matrix,\\nmeaning it has the same amount of variance in each direction. The second has a diagonal\\ncovariane matrix, meaning it can control the variance separately along each axis-aligned\\ndirection. This example has more variance along the x2 axis than along the x1 axis. The\\nthird component has a full-rank covariance matrix, allowing it to control the variance\\nseparately along an abitrary basis of directions.\\n\\nOne of these functions is the logistic sigmoid:\\n\\nÏ x( ) =\\n\\n1\\n\\n1 + exp(\\n\\n.\\n)âx\\n\\n(3.30)\\n\\nThe logistic sigmoid is commonly used to produce the Ï parameter of a Bernoulli\\ndistribution because its range is (0, 1), which lies within the valid range of values\\nfor the Ï parameter. See Fig. 3.3 for a graph of the sigmoid function. The sigmoid\\nfunction saturates when its argument is very positive or very negative, meaning\\nthat the function becomes very ï¬at and insensitive to small changes in its input.\\n\\nAnother commonly encountered function is the\\n\\nsoftplus\\n\\nfunction (Dugas\\n\\net al.,\\n\\n2001):\\n\\nÎ¶ x\\nx .\\n( ) = log (1 + exp( ))\\n\\n(3.31)\\n\\nThe softplus function can be useful for producing the Î² or Ï parameter of a normal\\ndistribution because its range is (0,â). It also arises commonly when manipulating\\nexpressions involving sigmoids. The name of the softplus function comes from the\\nfact that it is a smoothed or âsoftenedâ version of\\n\\nx+ = max(0 ), x .\\n\\n(3.32)\\n\\nSee Fig. 3.4 for a graph of the softplus function.\\n\\n67\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3.

The general version presented here was\\nindependently discovered by Pierre-Simon Laplace.\\n\\n69\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\n3.12 Technical Details of Continuous Variables\\n\\nA proper formal understanding of continuous random variables and probability\\ndensity functions requires developing probability theory in terms of a branch of\\nmathematics known as measure theory. Measure theory is beyond the scope of\\nthis textbook, but we can brieï¬y sketch some of the issues that measure theory is\\nemployed to resolve.\\n\\nIn Sec. 3.3.2, we saw that the probability of a continuous vector-valued x lying\\nin some set S is given by the integral of p(x ) over the set S. Some choices of set S\\ncan produce paradoxes. For example, it is possible to construct two sets S1 and\\nS2 such that p(x â S1) + p(x â S 2) > 1 but S1 â© S2 = â. These sets are generally\\nconstructed making very heavy use of the inï¬nite precision of real numbers, for\\nexample by making fractal-shaped sets or sets that are deï¬ned by transforming\\nthe set of rational numbers2 . One of the key contributions of measure theory is to\\nprovide a characterization of the set of sets that we can compute the probability\\nof without encountering paradoxes. In this book, we only integrate over sets with\\nrelatively simple descriptions, so this aspect of measure theory never becomes a\\nrelevant concern.\\n\\nFor our purposes, measure theory is more useful for describing theorems that\\napply to most points in Rn but do not apply to some corner cases. Measure theory\\nprovides a rigorous way of describing that a set of points is negligibly small. Such\\na set is said to have âmeasure zero.â We do not formally deï¬ne this concept in this\\ntextbook. However, it is useful to understand the intuition that a set of measure\\nzero occupies no volume in the space we are measuring. For example, within R2 , a\\nline has measure zero, while a ï¬lled polygon has positive measure. Likewise, an\\nindividual point has measure zero. Any union of countably many sets that each\\nhave measure zero also has measure zero (so the set of all the rational numbers\\nhas measure zero, for instance).\\n\\nAnother useful term from measure theory is âalmost everywhere.â A property\\nthat holds almost everywhere holds throughout all of space except for on a set of\\nmeasure zero. Because the exceptions occupy a negligible amount of space, they\\ncan be safely ignored for many applications. Some important results in probability\\ntheory hold for all discrete values but only hold âalmost everywhereâ for continuous\\nvalues.\\n\\nAnother technical detail of continuous variables relates to handling continuous\\nrandom variables that are deterministic functions of one another. Suppose we have\\ntwo random variables, x and y, such that y = g(x), where g is an invertible, con-\\n\\n2The Banach-Tarski theorem provides a fun example of such sets.\\n\\n70\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\ntinuous, diï¬erentiable transformation. One might expect that py(y ) =p x(gâ1(y )).\\nThis is actually not the case.\\n\\nAs a simple example, suppose we have scalar random variables x and y. Suppose\\nIf we use the rule p y(y) = p x(2 y) then py will be 0\\non this interval. This means\\n\\ny = x\\neverywhere except the interval [0 , 1\\n2 ]\\n\\n2 and x â¼ U(0,1).\\n\\n, and it will be\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\ue05a py ( ) =\\n\\ny dy\\n\\n1\\n2\\n\\n,\\n\\n(3.43)\\n\\nwhich violates the deï¬nition of a probability distribution.\\n\\nThis common mistake is wrong because it fails to account for the distortion\\nof space introduced by the function g. Recall that the probability of x lying in\\nan inï¬nitesimally small region with volume Î´x is given by p( x)Î´x. Since g can\\nexpand or contract space, the inï¬nitesimal volume surrounding x in x space may\\nhave diï¬erent volume in\\n\\nspace.\\n\\ny\\n\\nTo see how to correct the problem, we return to the scalar case. We need to\\n\\npreserve the property\\n\\nSolving from this, we obtain\\n\\n|py( ( ))\\n\\ng x dy|\\n\\n=\\n\\n|p x( )x dx .|\\n\\nor equivalently\\n\\nIn higher dimensions, the derivative generalizes to the determinant of the Jacobian\\nmatrixâthe matrix with J i,j = âxi\\nâyj\\n\\n.

It was originally invented\\nto study sending messages from discrete alphabets over a noisy channel, such as\\ncommunication via radio transmission. In this context, information theory tells how\\nto design optimal codes and calculate the expected length of messages sampled from\\n\\n71\\n\\n(3.44)\\n\\n(3.45)\\n\\n(3.46)\\n\\n(3.47)\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nspeciï¬c probability distributions using various encoding schemes. In the context of\\nmachine learning, we can also apply information theory to continuous variables\\nwhere some of these message length interpretations do not apply. This ï¬eld is\\nfundamental to many areas of electrical engineering and computer science. In this\\ntextbook, we mostly use a few key ideas from information theory to characterize\\nprobability distributions or quantify similarity between probability distributions.\\nFor more detail on information theory, see Cover and Thomas (2006) or MacKay\\n(2003).\\n\\nThe basic intuition behind information theory is that learning that an unlikely\\nevent has occurred is more informative than learning that a likely event has\\noccurred. A message saying âthe sun rose this morningâ is so uninformative as\\nto be unnecessary to send, but a message saying âthere was a solar eclipse this\\nmorningâ is very informative.\\n\\nWe would like to quantify information in a way that formalizes this intuition.\\n\\nSpeciï¬cally,\\n\\nâ¢ Likely events should have low information content, and in the extreme case,\\nevents that are guaranteed to happen should have no information content\\nwhatsoever.\\n\\nâ¢ Less likely events should have higher information content.\\nâ¢ Independent events should have additive information. For example, ï¬nding\\nout that a tossed coin has come up as heads twice should convey twice as\\nmuch information as ï¬nding out that a tossed coin has come up as heads\\nonce.\\n\\nIn order to satisfy all three of these properties, we deï¬ne the self-information\\n\\nof an event x\\n\\n= x\\n\\nto be\\n\\nI x\\n( ) = \\n\\nlogâ\\n\\nP x .\\n( )\\n\\n(3.48)\\n\\nIn this book, we always use log to mean the natural logarithm, with base e. Our\\ndeï¬nition of I(x) is therefore written in units of\\n. One nat is the amount of\\ninformation gained by observing an event of probability 1\\ne . Other texts use base-2\\nlogarithms and units called\\nshannons\\n; information measured in bits is just\\na rescaling of information measured in nats.\\n\\nnats\\n\\nbits\\n\\nor\\n\\nWhen x is continuous, we use the same deï¬nition of information by analogy,\\nbut some of the properties from the discrete case are lost. For example, an event\\nwith unit density still has zero information, despite not being an event that is\\nguaranteed to occur.\\n\\n72\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3.

The entropy is given by\\nlog . When p is near 0, the distribution\\nis nearly deterministic, because the random variable is nearly always 0. When p is near 1,\\nthe distribution is nearly deterministic, because the random variable is nearly always 1.\\nWhen p = 0 .5, the entropy is maximal, because the distribution is uniform over the two\\noutcomes.\\n\\n(pâ 1) log(1â p )â p\\n\\np\\n\\nSelf-information deals only with a single outcome.

In other words, the Shannon entropy of a distribution is the\\nexpected amount of information in an event drawn from that distribution. It gives\\na lower bound on the number of bits (if the logarithm is base 2, otherwise the units\\nare diï¬erent) needed on average to encode symbols drawn from a distribution P.\\nDistributions that are nearly deterministic (where the outcome is nearly certain)\\nhave low entropy; distributions that are closer to uniform have high entropy. See\\nFig. 3.5 for a demonstration. When x is continous, the Shannon entropy is known\\nas the diï¬erential entropy.\\n\\nIf we have two separate probability distributions P(x) and Q(x) over the same\\nrandom variable x, we can measure how diï¬erent these two distributions are using\\nthe Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence:\\n\\nDKL(\\n\\nP Q\\ue06b\\n\\n) = \\n\\nE xâ¼P\\ue014log\\n\\nP x( )\\n\\nQ x( )\\ue015 = Exâ¼P [log ( )\\n\\nP x â\\n\\n73\\n\\nlog ( )]\\nQ x .\\n\\n(3.50)\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3. PROBABILITY AND INFORMATION THEORY\\n\\nIn the case of discrete variables, it is the extra amount of information (measured\\nin bits if we use the base\\nlogarithm, but in machine learning we usually use nats\\nand the natural logarithm) needed to send a message containing symbols drawn\\nfrom probability distribution P , when we use a code that was designed to minimize\\nthe length of messages drawn from probability distribution\\n\\n.Q\\n\\n2\\n\\nThe KL divergence has many useful properties, most notably that it is non-\\nnegative. The KL divergence is 0 if and only if P and Qare the same distribution in\\nthe case of discrete variables, or equal âalmost everywhereâ in the case of continuous\\nvariables. Because the KL divergence is non-negative and measures the diï¬erence\\nbetween two distributions, it is often conceptualized as measuring some sort of\\ndistance between these distributions. However, it is not a true distance measure\\nbecause it is not symmetric: DKL(P Q\\ue06b ) \\ue036= DKL( Q P\\ue06b ) for some P and Q. This\\nasymmetry means that there are important consequences to the choice of whether\\nto use DKL(\\n\\n. See Fig. 3.6 for more detail.\\n\\nor DKL (\\n\\n)\\n\\nP Q\\ue06b\\n\\n)Q P\\ue06b\\n\\nA quantity that is closely related to the KL divergence is the cross-entropy\\nH (P, Q ) = H (P) + DKL(P Q\\ue06b ), which is similar to the KL divergence but lacking\\nthe term on the left:\\n(3.51)\\n\\nH P, Q(\\n\\n) = âE\\n\\nxâ¼P log ( )Q x .\\n\\nMinimizing the cross-entropy with respect to Q is equivalent to minimizing the\\nKL divergence, because\\n\\ndoes not participate in the omitted term.\\n\\nQ\\n\\nWhen computing many of these quantities, it is common to encounter expres-\\nsions of the form 0log 0.

Often, these probability distributions involve\\ndirect interactions between relatively few variables. Using a single function to\\ndescribe the entire joint probability distribution can be very ineï¬cient (both\\ncomputationally and statistically).\\n\\nInstead of using a single function to represent a probability distribution, we\\ncan split a probability distribution into many factors that we multiply together.\\nFor example, suppose we have three random variables: a, b and c . Suppose that\\na inï¬uences the value of b and b inï¬uences the value of c, but that a and c are\\nindependent given b. We can represent the probability distribution over all three\\n\\n74\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3.

Suppose we have a distribution p(x ) and\\nwish to approximate it with another distribution q(x). We have the choice of minimizing\\neither DKL( p q\\ue06b ) or DKL( q p\\ue06b ). We illustrate the eï¬ect of this choice using a mixture of\\ntwo Gaussians for p, and a single Gaussian for q. The choice of which direction of the\\nKL divergence to use is problem-dependent. Some applications require an approximation\\nthat usually places high probability anywhere that the true distribution places high\\nprobability, while other applications require an approximation that rarely places high\\nprobability anywhere that the true distribution places low probability. The choice of the\\ndirection of the KL divergence reï¬ects which of these considerations takes priority for each\\napplication. (Left) The eï¬ect of minimizing DKL (p q\\ue06b ). In this case, we select a q that has\\nhigh probability where p has high probability. When p has multiple modes, q chooses to\\nblur the modes together, in order to put high probability mass on all of them. (Right) The\\neï¬ect of minimizing DKL (q p\\ue06b ). In this case, we select a q that has low probability where\\np has low probability. When p has multiple modes that are suï¬ciently widely separated,\\nas in this ï¬gure, the KL divergence is minimized by choosing a single mode, in order to\\navoid putting probability mass in the low-probability areas between modes of p . Here, we\\nillustrate the outcome when q is chosen to emphasize the left mode. We could also have\\nachieved an equal value of the KL divergence by choosing the right mode. If the modes\\nare not separated by a suï¬ciently strong low probability region, then this direction of the\\nKL divergence can still choose to blur the modes.\\n\\n75\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3.

Each factor uses a number of parameters that is\\nexponential in the number of variables in the factor. This means that we can greatly\\nreduce the cost of representing a distribution if we are able to ï¬nd a factorization\\ninto distributions over fewer variables.\\n\\nWe can describe these kinds of factorizations using graphs. Here we use the\\nword âgraphâ in the sense of graph theory: a set of vertices that may be connected\\nto each other with edges. When we represent the factorization of a probability\\ndistribution with a graph, we call it a structured probabilistic model\\ngraphical\\nmodel.\\n\\nor\\n\\nThere are two main kinds of structured probabilistic models: directed and\\nundirected. Both kinds of graphical models use a graph G in which each node\\nin the graph corresponds to a random variable, and an edge connecting two\\nrandom variables means that the probability distribution is able to represent direct\\ninteractions between those two random variables.\\n\\nDirected models use graphs with directed edges, and they represent factoriza-\\ntions into conditional probability distributions, as in the example above. Speciï¬cally,\\na directed model contains one factor for every random variable x i in the distribution,\\nand that factor consists of the conditional distribution over xi given the parents of\\nxi, denoted P a G(x i):\\n\\n(3.53)\\n\\np( ) =x \\ue059i\\n\\np (xi | P aG (xi )) .\\n\\nSee Fig. 3.7 for an example of a directed graph and the factorization of probability\\ndistributions it represents.\\n\\nUndirected models use graphs with undirected edges, and they represent fac-\\ntorizations into a set of functions; unlike in the directed case, these functions are\\nusually not probability distributions of any kind. Any set of nodes that are all\\nconnected to each other in G is called a clique. Each clique C ( )i\\nin an undirected\\nmodel is associated with a factor Ï( )i (C ( )i ). These factors are just functions, not\\nprobability distributions. The output of each factor must be non-negative, but\\nthere is no constraint that the factor must sum or integrate to 1 like a probability\\ndistribution.\\n\\nThe probability of a conï¬guration of random variables is proportional to the\\nproduct of all of these factorsâassignments that result in larger factor values are\\n\\n76\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3.

       "'Machine learning algorithms often involve probability distributions over a very\\nlarge number of random variables. Often, these probability distributions involve\\ndirect interactions between relatively few variables. Using a single function to\\ndescribe the entire joint probability distribution can be very ineï¬cient (both\\ncomputationally and statistically).\\n\\nInstead of using a single function to represent a probability distribution, we\\ncan split a probability distribution into many factors that we multiply together.\\nFor example, suppose we have three random variables: a, b and c . Suppose that\\na inï¬uences the value of b and b inï¬uences the value of c, but that a and c are\\nindependent given b. We can represent the probability distribution over all three\\n\\n74\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3.

Suppose we have a distribution p(x ) and\\nwish to approximate it with another distribution q(x). We have the choice of minimizing\\neither DKL( p q\\ue06b ) or DKL( q p\\ue06b ). We illustrate the eï¬ect of this choice using a mixture of\\ntwo Gaussians for p, and a single Gaussian for q. The choice of which direction of the\\nKL divergence to use is problem-dependent. Some applications require an approximation\\nthat usually places high probability anywhere that the true distribution places high\\nprobability, while other applications require an approximation that rarely places high\\nprobability anywhere that the true distribution places low probability. The choice of the\\ndirection of the KL divergence reï¬ects which of these considerations takes priority for each\\napplication. (Left) The eï¬ect of minimizing DKL (p q\\ue06b ). In this case, we select a q that has\\nhigh probability where p has high probability. When p has multiple modes, q chooses to\\nblur the modes together, in order to put high probability mass on all of them. (Right) The\\neï¬ect of minimizing DKL (q p\\ue06b ). In this case, we select a q that has low probability where\\np has low probability. When p has multiple modes that are suï¬ciently widely separated,\\nas in this ï¬gure, the KL divergence is minimized by choosing a single mode, in order to\\navoid putting probability mass in the low-probability areas between modes of p . Here, we\\nillustrate the outcome when q is chosen to emphasize the left mode. We could also have\\nachieved an equal value of the KL divergence by choosing the right mode. If the modes\\nare not separated by a suï¬ciently strong low probability region, then this direction of the\\nKL divergence can still choose to blur the modes.\\n\\n75\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3.

Each factor uses a number of parameters that is\\nexponential in the number of variables in the factor. This means that we can greatly\\nreduce the cost of representing a distribution if we are able to ï¬nd a factorization\\ninto distributions over fewer variables.\\n\\nWe can describe these kinds of factorizations using graphs. Here we use the\\nword âgraphâ in the sense of graph theory: a set of vertices that may be connected\\nto each other with edges. When we represent the factorization of a probability\\ndistribution with a graph, we call it a structured probabilistic model\\ngraphical\\nmodel.\\n\\nor\\n\\nThere are two main kinds of structured probabilistic models: directed and\\nundirected. Both kinds of graphical models use a graph G in which each node\\nin the graph corresponds to a random variable, and an edge connecting two\\nrandom variables means that the probability distribution is able to represent direct\\ninteractions between those two random variables.\\n\\nDirected models use graphs with directed edges, and they represent factoriza-\\ntions into conditional probability distributions, as in the example above. Speciï¬cally,\\na directed model contains one factor for every random variable x i in the distribution,\\nand that factor consists of the conditional distribution over xi given the parents of\\nxi, denoted P a G(x i):\\n\\n(3.53)\\n\\np( ) =x \\ue059i\\n\\np (xi | P aG (xi )) .\\n\\nSee Fig. 3.7 for an example of a directed graph and the factorization of probability\\ndistributions it represents.\\n\\nUndirected models use graphs with undirected edges, and they represent fac-\\ntorizations into a set of functions; unlike in the directed case, these functions are\\nusually not probability distributions of any kind. Any set of nodes that are all\\nconnected to each other in G is called a clique. Each clique C ( )i\\nin an undirected\\nmodel is associated with a factor Ï( )i (C ( )i ). These factors are just functions, not\\nprobability distributions. The output of each factor must be non-negative, but\\nthere is no constraint that the factor must sum or integrate to 1 like a probability\\ndistribution.\\n\\nThe probability of a conï¬guration of random variables is proportional to the\\nproduct of all of these factorsâassignments that result in larger factor values are\\n\\n76\\n\\n\\x0cCHAPTER 3.
