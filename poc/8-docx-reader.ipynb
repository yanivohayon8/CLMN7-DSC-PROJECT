      "Introduction\n",
      "This text explains how to use mathematical models and methods to analyze prob-lems that arise in computer science. The notion of a proof plays a central role in this work.\n",
      "Simply put, a proof is a method of establishing truth. Like beauty, “truth” some-times depends on the eye of the beholder, and it should not be surprising that what constitutes a proof differs among fields. For example, in the judicial system, legal truth is decided by a jury based on the allowable evidence presented at trial. In the business world, authoritative truth is specified by a trusted person or organization, or maybe just your boss. In fields such as physics and biology, scientific truth\n",
      "is confirmed by experiment. In statistics, probable truth is established by statistical analysis of sample data.\n",
      "Philosophical proof involves careful exposition and persuasion typically based on a series of small, plausible arguments. The best example begins with “Cogito ergo sum,” a Latin sentence that translates as “I think, therefore I am.” It comes from the beginning of a 17th century essay by the mathematician/philosopher, Rene´ Descartes, and it is one of the most famous quotes in the world: do a web search on the phrase and you will be flooded with hits.\n",
      "Deducing your existence from the fact that you’re thinking about your existence is a pretty cool and persuasive-sounding idea. However, with just a few more lines of argument in this vein, Descartes \n",
      "to conclude that there is an infinitely beneficent God. Whether or not you believe in a beneficent God, you’ll probably agree that any very short proof of God’s existence is bound to be far-fetched. So\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually, only scientific falsehood can be demonstrated by an experiment—when the experiment fails to behave as predicted. But no amount of experiment can confirm that the next experiment won’t fail. For this reason, scientists rarely speak of truth, but rather of theories that accurately predict past, and anticipated future, experiments.\n",

      "Proofs\n",
      "even in masterful hands, this approach is not reliable. Mathematics has its own specific notion of “proof.”\n",
      "Definition. A mathematical proof of a proposition is a chain of logical deductions leading to the proposition from a base set of axioms.\n",
      "The three key ideas in this definition are highlighted: proposition, logical de-duction, and axiom. These three ideas are explained in the following chapters, beginning with propositions in Chapter \n",
      ". We will then provide lots of examples of proofs and even some examples of “false proofs” (that is, arguments that look like a proof but that contain missteps, or deductions that aren’t so logical when exam-ined closely). False proofs are often even more important as examples than correct proofs, because they are uniquely helpful with honing your skills at making sure each step of a proof follows logically from prior steps.\n",
      "Creating a good proof is a lot like creating a beautiful work of art. In fact, mathematicians often refer to really good proofs as being “elegant” or “beautiful.” As with any endeavor, it will probably take a little practice before your fellow students use such praise when referring to your proofs, but to get you started in the right direction, we will provide templates for the most useful proof techniques in Chapters \n",
      "and \n",
      ". We then apply these techniques in Chapter \n",
      "to establish some important facts about numbers; facts that form the underpinning of one of the world’s most widely-used cryptosystems.\n",
      "\n",
      "“mcs-ftl” — 2010/9/8 — 0:40 — page 5 — #11\n",
      "\n",
      "Propositions\n",
      "Definition. A proposition is a statement that is either true or false.\n",
      "For example, both of the following statements are propositions. The first is true and the second is false.\n",
      "Proposition 1.0.1. 2 + 3 = 5.\n",
      "Proposition 1.0.2. 1 + 1 = 3.\n",
      "Being true or false doesn’t sound like much of a limitation, but it does exclude statements such as, “Wherefore art thou Romeo?” and “Give me an A!”.\n",
      "Unfortunately, it is not always easy to decide if a proposition is true or false, or even what the proposition means. In part, this is because the English language is riddled with ambiguities. For example, consider the following statements:\n",
      "“You may have cake, or you may have ice cream.”\n",
      "“If pigs can fly, then you can understand the Chebyshev bound.”\n",
      "“If you can solve any problem we come up with, then you get an A for the course.”\n",
      "“Every American has a dream.”\n",
      "What precisely do these sentences mean? Can you have both cake and ice cream or must you choose just one dessert? If the second sentence is true, then is the Chebyshev bound incomprehensible? If you can solve some problems we come up with but not all, then do you get an A for the course? And can you still get an A even if you can’t solve any of the problems? Does the last sentence imply that all Americans have the same dream or might some of them have different dreams?\n",
      "Some uncertainty is tolerable in normal conversation. But when we need to formulate ideas precisely—as in mathematics and programming—the ambiguities inherent in everyday language can be a real problem. We can’t hope to make an exact argument if we’re not sure exactly what the statements mean. So before we start into mathematics, we need to investigate the problem of how to talk about mathematics.\n",
      "To get around the ambiguity of English, mathematicians have devised a special mini-language for talking about logical relationships. This language mostly uses ordinary English words and phrases such as “or”, “implies”, and “for all”. But\n",

      "mathematicians endow these words with definitions more precise than those found in an ordinary dictionary. Without knowing these definitions, you might sometimes get the gist of statements in this language, but you would regularly get misled about what they really meant.\n",
      "Surprisingly, in the midst of learning the language of mathematics, we’ll come across the most important open problem in computer science—a problem whose solution could change the world.\n",

      "Compound Propositions\n",
      "In English, we can modify, combine, and relate propositions with words such as “not”, “and”, “or”, “implies”, and “if-then”. For example, we can combine three propositions into one like this:\n",
      "If all humans are mortal and all Greeks are human, then all Greeks are mortal.\n",
      "For the next while, we won’t be much concerned with the internals of propositions— whether they involve mathematics or Greek mortality—but rather with how propo-sitions are combined and related. So we’ll frequently use variables such as P and Q in place of specific propositions such as “All humans are mortal” and “2 C 3 D 5”. The understanding is that these variables, like propositions, can take on only the values T (true) and F (false). Such true/false variables are sometimes called Boolean variables after their inventor, George—you guessed it—Boole.\n",

For example, one of the assumptions was “There is a straight line segment between every pair of points.” Propositions like these that are simply accepted as true are called axioms.\n",

      "In practice, the notion of proof is a moving target. Proofs in a professional research journal are generally unintelligible to all but a few experts who know all the terminology and prior results used in the proof. Conversely, proofs in the first weeks of an introductory course like Mathematics for Computer Science would be regarded as tediously long-winded by a professional mathematician. In fact, what we accept as a good proof later in the term will be different than what we consider to be a good proof in the first couple of weeks of this course. But even so, we can offer some general tips on writing good proofs:\n",
      "State your game plan. A good proof begins by explaining the general line of rea-soning. For example, “We use case analysis” or “We argue by contradiction.”\n",
      "Keep a linear flow. Sometimes proofs are written like mathematical mosaics, with juicy tidbits of independent reasoning sprinkled throughout. This is not good. The steps of an argument should follow one another in an intelligible order.\n",
      "A proof is an essay, not a calculation. Many students initially write proofs the way they compute integrals. The result is a long sequence of expressions without explanation, making it very hard to follow. This is bad. A good proof usually looks like an essay with some equations thrown in. Use complete sentences.\n",
      "Avoid excessive symbolism. Your reader is probably good at understanding words, but much less skilled at reading arcane mathematical symbols. So use words where you reasonably can.\n",
      "Revise and simplify. Your readers will be grateful.\n",
      "Introduce notation thoughtfully. Sometimes an argument can be greatly simpli-fied by introducing a variable, devising a special notation, or defining a new term. But do this sparingly since you’re requiring the reader to remember all that new stuff. And remember to actually define the meanings of new variables, terms, or notations; don’t just start using them!\n",
      "Structure long proofs. Long programs are usually broken into a hierarchy of smaller procedures. Long proofs are much the same. Facts needed in your proof that are easily stated, but not readily proved are best pulled out and proved in pre-liminary lemmas. Also, if you are repeating essentially the same argument over and over, try to capture that argument in a general lemma, which you can cite repeatedly instead.\n",
      "Be wary of the “obvious”. When familiar or truly obvious facts are needed in a proof, it’s OK to label them as such and to not prove them. But remember\n",

      "Most especially, don’t use phrases like “clearly” or “obviously” in an attempt to bully the reader into accepting something you’re having trouble proving. Also, go on the alert whenever you see one of these phrases in someone else’s proof.\n",
      "Finish. At some point in a proof, you’ll have established all the essential facts you need. Resist the temptation to quit and leave the reader to draw the “obvious” conclusion. Instead, tie everything together yourself and explain why the original claim follows.\n",
      "The analogy between good proofs and good programs extends beyond structure. The same rigorous thinking needed for proofs is essential in the design of criti-cal computer systems. When algorithms and protocols only “mostly work” due to reliance on hand-waving arguments, the results can range from problematic to catastrophic. An early example was the Therac 25, a machine that provided radia-tion therapy to cancer victims, but occasionally killed them with massive overdoses due to a software race condition. A more recent (August 2004) example involved a single faulty command to a computer system used by United and American Airlines that grounded the entire fleet of both companies—and all their passengers!\n",
      "It is a certainty that we’ll all one day be at the mercy of critical computer systems designed by you and your classmates. So we really hope that you’ll develop the ability to formulate rock-solid logical arguments that a system actually does what you think it does!\n",

For example, with his model in hand, Turing immediately proved that there exist problems that no computer can solve—no matter how ingenious the programmer.

He foresaw that preserving military secrets would be vital in the coming conflict and proposed a way to encrypt communica-tions using number theory. This is an idea that has ricocheted up to our own time. Today, number theory is the basis for numerous public-key cryptosystems, digital signature schemes, cryptographic hash functions, and electronic payment systems. Furthermore, military funding agencies are among the biggest investors in crypto-graphic research. Sorry Hardy!\n",

More precisely, a property of a graph is said to be preserved under isomorphism if whenever G has that property, every graph isomorphic to G also has that property. For example, isomorphic graphs must have the same number of vertices. What’s more, if f is a graph isomorphism that maps a vertex, v, of one graph to the vertex, f .v/, of an isomorphic graph, then by definition of isomor-phism, every vertex adjacent to v in the first graph will be mapped by f to a vertex adjacent to f .v/ in the isomorphic graph. This means that v and f .v/ will have the same degree. So if one graph has a vertex of degree 4 and another does not, then they can’t be isomorphic.

Now, you may be wondering what marriage has to do with computer science, and with good reason. It turns out that the techniques we will develop apply to much more general scenarios where instead of matching men to women, we need to match packets to paths in a network, applicants to jobs, or Internet traffic to web servers. And, as we will describe later, these techniques are widely used in practice.\n",

      "Sexual demographics have been the subject of many studies. In one of the largest, researchers from the University of Chicago interviewed a random sample of 2500 Americans over several years to try to get an answer to this question. Their study, published in 1994, and entitled The Social Organization of Sexuality found that, on average, men have 74% more opposite-gender partners than women.\n",
      "Other studies have found that the disparity is even larger. In particular, ABC News claimed that the average man has 20 partners over his lifetime, and the aver-age woman has 6, for a percentage disparity of 233%. The ABC News study, aired on Primetime Live in 2004, purported to be one of the most scientific ever done, with only a 2.5% margin of error. It was called “American Sex Survey: A peek between the sheets.” The promotion for the study is even better:\n",

And we don’t even have trustworthy estimates of how many edges there are, let alone exactly which couples are adja-cent. But it turns out that we don’t need to know any of this to debunk the sex surveys—we just need to figure out the relationship between the average number of partners per male and partners per female. To do this, we note that every edge is incident to exactly one M vertex and one F vertex (remember, we’re only con-sidering male-female relationships); so the sum of the degrees of the M vertices equals the number of edges, and the sum of the degrees of the F vertices equals the\n",

So we know that on average, males have 3.5% more opposite-gender partners than females. Of course, this statistic really says nothing about any sex’s promiscuity or selectivity. Remark-ably, promiscuity is completely irrelevant in this analysis. That is because the ratio of the average number of partners is completely determined by the relative number of males and females. Collectively, males and females have the same number of opposite gender partners, since it takes one of each set for every partnership, but there are fewer males, so they have a higher ratio. This means that the University of Chicago, ABC, and the Federal Government studies are way off. After a huge effort, they gave a totally wrong answer.\n",

They went on at great length to explain why this “remarkable phenomenon” might be true.

So she is sure to have today’s favorite man among her suitors tomorrow. That means she will be able to choose a favorite suitor tomorrow who is at least as desirable to her as today’s favorite.

Similarly, a man keeps serenading the woman he most prefers among those on his list until he must cross her off, at which point he serenades the next most preferred woman on his list. So from the man’s perspective, the woman he is serenading can only change for the worse. Sounds like a good deal for the women.\n",
      "But it’s not! The fact is that from the beginning, the men are serenading their first choice woman, and the desirability of the woman being serenaded decreases only enough to ensure overall stability. The Mating Ritual actually does as well as possible for all the men and does the worst possible job for the women.\n",
      "To explain all this we need some definitions. Let’s begin by observing that while The Mating Ritual produces one stable matching, there may be other stable match-ings among the same set of men and women. For example, reversing the roles of men and women will often yield a different stable matching among them.\n",

      ". The NRMP has, since the turn of the twentieth century, assigned each year’s pool of medical school graduates to hospital residencies (formerly called “internships”) with hospitals and graduates playing the roles of men and women. (In this case, there may be multiple women married to one man, a scenario we consider in the problem section at the end of the chapter.). Before the Ritual-like algorithm was adopted, there were chronic disrup-tions and awkward countermeasures taken to preserve assignments of graduates to residencies. The Ritual resolved these problems so successfully, that it was used essentially without change at least through 1989.\n",
      "The Internet infrastructure company, Akamai, also uses a variation of the Mating Ritual to assign web traffic to its servers. In the early days, Akamai used other com-binatorial optimization algorithms that got to be too slow as the number of servers (over 65,000 in 2010) and requests (over 800 billion per day) increased. Akamai switched to a Ritual-like approach since it is fast and can be run in a distributed manner. In this case, web requests correspond to women and web servers corre-spond to men. The web requests have preferences based on latency and packet loss, and the web servers have preferences based on cost of bandwidth and collocation.\n",

The updates cannot be done at the same time since the servers need to be taken down in order to deploy the software. Also, the servers cannot be handled one at a time, since it would take forever to update them all (each one takes about an hour). Moreover, certain pairs of servers cannot be taken down at the same time since they have common critical functions. This problem was eventually solved by making a 75,000-node conflict graph and coloring it with 8 colors—so only 8 waves of install are needed!\n",

Frequencies are precious and expensive, so you want to minimize the number handed out. This amounts to finding the minimum coloring for a graph whose vertices are the stations and whose edges connect stations with overlapping areas.\n",
      "Coloring also comes up in allocating registers for program variables. While a variable is in use, its value needs to be saved in a register. Registers can be reused for different variables but two variables need different registers if they are refer-enced during overlapping intervals of program execution. So register allocation is the coloring problem for a graph whose vertices are the variables; vertices are ad-jacent if their intervals overlap, and the colors are registers.

Surprisingly, it’s another of those million dollar prize questions to find an efficient procedure to tell if a planar graph really needs four colors or if three will actually do the job. (It’s always easy to tell if an arbitrary graph is 2-colorable.) In Sec-tion \n",
      ", we’ll develop enough planar graph theory to present an easy proof that all planar graphs are 5-colorable.\n",

You move second: given her specification, you choose the precise paths that the packets should take through your network; you’re trying to avoid overloading any one switch. Then her next move is to pick a switch with as large as possible a number of packets passing through it; this number is her score in the competition. The max congestion of your network is the largest score she can ensure; in other words, it is precisely the max-value of this game.\n",

      "In the next several chapters, we’re going to present a lot of rules for counting. These rules are actually theorems, and we will prove some of them, but our focus won’t be on the proofs per se—our objective is to teach you simple counting as a practical skill, like integration.\n",

      "Would you prefer a million dollars today or $50,000 a year for the rest of your life? On the one hand, instant gratification is nice. On the other hand, the total dollars received at $50K per year is much larger if you live long enough.\n",
      "Formally, this is a question about the value of an annuity. An annuity is a finan-cial instrument that pays out a fixed amount of money at the beginning of every year for some specified number of years. In particular, an n-year, m-payment annuity pays m dollars at the start of each year for n years. In some cases, n is finite, but not always. Examples include lottery payouts, student loans, and home mortgages. There are even Wall Street people who specialize in trading annuities.\n",
      "A key question is, “What is an annuity worth?” For example, lotteries often pay out jackpots over many years. Intuitively, $50,000 a year for 20 years ought to be worth less than a million dollars right now. If you had all the cash right away, you could invest it and begin collecting interest. But what if the choice were between $50,000 a year for 20 years and a half million dollars today? Now it is not clear which option is better.\n",

      "\t\n",
      "The Future Value of Money\n",
      "In order to answer such questions, we need to know what a dollar paid out in the future is worth today. To model this, let’s assume that money can be invested at a fixed annual interest rate p. We’ll assume an 8% rate\n",
      "for the rest of the discussion.\n",
      "Here is why the interest rate p matters. Ten dollars invested today at interest rate\n",
      "will become .1 C p/ 10 D 10:80 dollars in a year, .1 C p/\n",
      "2\n",
      " 10 11:66 dollars in two years, and so forth. Looked at another way, ten dollars paid out a year from now is only really worth 1=.1 C p/ 10 9:26 dollars today. The reason is that if we had the $9.26 today, we could invest it and would have $10.00 in a year anyway. Therefore, p determines the value of money paid out in the future.\n",
      "So for an n-year, m-payment annuity, the first payment of m dollars is truly worth m dollars. But the second payment a year later is worth only m=.1 C p/ dollars. Similarly, the third payment is worth m=.1 C p/\n",
      "2\n",
      ", and the n-th payment is worth only m=.1 C p/\n",

That is because the center of mass of a single block is in the middle of the block (which is distance 1=2 from the right edge of the block). If we were to place the block so that its right edge is more than 1=2 from the edge of the table, the center of mass would be over air and the block would tip over.

Essentially all recurrences in these two classes are solvable using cookbook techniques; you follow the recipe and get the answer. A drawback is that calculation replaces insight.

      "This is the typical situation: the asymptotic solution to a divide-and-conquer recurrence is independent of the boundary conditions. Intuitively, if the bottom-level operation in a recursive algorithm takes, say, twice as long, then the overall running time will at most double. This matters in practice, but the factor of 2 is concealed by asymptotic notation. There are corner-case exceptions. For example, the solution to T .n/ D 2T .n=2/ is either .n/ or zero, depending on whether T .1/ is zero. These cases are of little practical interest, so we won’t consider them further.\n",
      "There is a second nagging issue with divide-and-conquer recurrences that does not arise with linear recurrences. Specifically, dividing a problem of size n may create subproblems of non-integer size. For example, the Merge Sort recurrence contains the term T .n=2/. So what if n is 15? How long does it take to sort seven-and-a-half items? Previously, we dodged this issue by analyzing Merge Sort only when the size of the input was a power of 2. But then we don’t know what happens for an input of size, say, 100.\n",
      "Of course, a practical implementation of Merge Sort would split the input ap-proximately in half, sort the halves recursively, and merge the results. For example, a list of 15 numbers would be split into lists of 7 and 8. More generally, a list of n numbers would be split into approximate halves of size dn=2e and bn=2c.

      " steps!\n",
      "Each recurrence has one strength and one weakness.

In Merge Sort, we divided the problem of size n into two subproblems of size n=2 (which is small), but needed .n 1/ additional steps (which is large). Yet, Merge Sort is faster by a mile!\n",
      "This suggests that generating smaller subproblems is far more important to al-gorithmic speed than reducing the additional steps per recursive call.

Boundary conditions matter greatly only when they give the dominant term a zero coefficient, which changes the asymptotic solution.\n",

The performance of a recursive procedure is usually dictated by the size and number of subproblems, rather than the amount of work per recursive call or time spent at the base of the recursion. In particular, if subproblems are smaller than the original by an additive factor, the solution is most often exponential. But if the subproblems are only a fraction the size of the original, then the solution is typically bounded by a polynomial.\n",

So settling the Continuum Hypothesis requires a new understanding of what sets should be to arrive at persuasive new axioms that extend ZFC and are strong enough to determine the truth of the Con-tinuum Hypothesis one way or the other.\n",

In practice, only logicians and set theorists have to worry about collections that are too big to be sets. In fact, at the end of the 19th century, even the general mathematical community doubted the relevance of what they called “Cantor’s paradise” of unfamiliar sets of arbitrary infinite size.\n",

      "Probability is one of the most important disciplines in all of the sciences. It is also one of the least well understood.\n",
      "Probability is especially important in computer science—it arises in virtually every branch of the field. In algorithm design and game theory, for example, ran-domized algorithms and strategies (those that use a random number generator as a key input for decision making) frequently outperform deterministic algorithms and strategies. In information theory and signal processing, an understanding of ran-domness is critical for filtering out noise and compressing data. In cryptography and digital rights management, probability is crucial for achieving security. The list of examples is long.\n",
      "Given the impact that probability has on computer science, it seems strange that probability should be so misunderstood by so many. Perhaps the trouble is that basic human intuition is wrong as often as it is right when it comes to problems involving random events. As a consequence, many students develop a fear of prob-ability. Indeed, we have witnessed many graduate oral exams where a student will solve the most horrendous calculation, only to then be tripped up by the simplest probability question. Indeed, even some faculty will start squirming if you ask them a question that starts “What is the probability that. . . ?”\n",
      "Our goal in the remaining chapters is to equip you with the tools that will enable you to easily and confidently solve problems involving probability.\n",
      "We begin in Chapter \n",
      "with the basic definitions and an elementary 4-step pro-cess that can be used to determine the probability that a specified event occurs. We illustrate the method on two famous problems where your intuition will probably fail you.\n",

      ". Random variables provide a more quantitative way to measure random events. For example, instead of determining the probability that it will rain, we may want to determine how much or how long it is likely to rain. This is closely related to the notion of the expected value of a random variables, which we will consider in Chapter \n",

      "Suppose you’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three doors. Behind one door is a car, behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say number 1, and the host, who knows what’s behind the doors, opens another door, say number 3, which has a goat. He says to you, ”Do you want to pick door number 2?” Is it to your advantage to switch your choice of doors?\n",

Marilyn replied that the contestant should indeed switch. She explained that if the car was behind either of the two unpicked doors—which is twice as likely as the the car being behind the picked door—the contestant wins by switching. But she soon received a torrent of letters, many from mathematicians, telling her that she was wrong. The problem became known as the Monty Hall Problem and it generated thousands of hours of heated debate.\n",
      "This incident highlights a fact about probability: the subject uncovers lots of examples where ordinary intuition leads to completely wrong conclusions. So until you’ve studied probabilities enough to have refined your intuition, a way to avoid errors is to fall back on a rigorous, systematic approach such as the Four Step Method that we will describe shortly. First, let’s make sure we really understand the setup for this problem. This is always a good thing to do when you are dealing with probability.\n",

      "So far we’ve enumerated all the possible outcomes of the experiment. Now we must start assessing the likelihood of those outcomes. In particular, the goal of this step is to assign each outcome a probability, indicating the fraction of the time this outcome is expected to occur. The sum of all outcome probabilities must be one, reflecting the fact that there always is an outcome.\n",
      "Ultimately, outcome probabilities are determined by the phenomenon we’re mod-eling and thus are not quantities that we can derive mathematically. However, math-ematics can help us compute the probability of every outcome based on fewer and more elementary modeling decisions. In particular, we’ll break the task of deter-mining outcome probabilities into two stages.\n",
      "Step 3a: Assign Edge Probabilities\n",
      "First, we record a probability on each edge of the tree diagram. These edge-probabilities are determined by the assumptions we made at the outset: that the prize is equally likely to be behind each door, that the player is equally likely to pick each door, and that the host is equally likely to reveal each goat, if he has a choice. Notice that when the host has no choice regarding which door to open, the single branch is assigned probability 1. For example, see Figure \n",
      ".\n",
      "Step 3b: Compute Outcome Probabilities\n",
      "Our next job is to convert edge probabilities into outcome probabilities. This is a purely mechanical process: the probability of an outcome is equal to the product of the edge-probabilities on the path from the root to that outcome. For example, the probability of the topmost outcome in Figure \n",

      "There’s an easy, intuitive justification for this rule. As the steps in an experiment progress randomly along a path from the root of the tree to a leaf, the probabilities on the edges indicate how likely the path is to proceed along each branch. For example, a path starting at the root in our example is equally likely to go down each of the three top-level branches.\n",
      "How likely is such a path to arrive at the topmost outcome, .A; A; B/? Well, there is a 1-in-3 chance that a path would follow the A-branch at the top level, a 1-in-3 chance it would continue along the A-branch at the second level, and 1-in-2 chance it would follow the B-branch at the third level. Thus, it seems that 1 path in 18 should arrive at the .A; A; B/ leaf, which is precisely the probability we assign it.\n",

But perhaps we’ve been tricky and put small numbers in both envelopes. Then your guess might not be so good!\n",

If it is bigger than x, then you know you’re peeking at the higher number. If it is smaller than x, then you’re peeking at the lower number. In other words, if you know a number x between the numbers in the envelopes, then you are certain to win the game.\n",
      "The only flaw with this brilliant strategy is that you do not know such an x. Oh well.\n",
      "But what if you try to guess x? There is some probability that you guess cor-rectly. In this case, you win 100% of the time. On the other hand, if you guess incorrectly, then you’re no worse off than before; your chance of winning is still 50%. Combining these two cases, your overall chance of winning is better than 50%!\n",

      "After you’ve selected the number x, you peek into an envelope and see some number T . If T > x, then you guess that you’re looking at the larger number. If T < x, then you guess that the other number is larger.\n",

For example, suppose that you would like to know how many Americans plan to vote for the Republican candidate in the next presidential election. It is infeasible to ask every American how they intend to vote, so pollsters will typically contact n Americans selected at random and then compute the fraction of those Americans that will vote Republican. This value is then used as the estimate of the number of all Americans that will vote Republican. For example, if 45% of the n contacted voters report that they will vote Republican, the pollster reports that 45% of all Americans will vote Republican. In addition, the pollster will usually also provide some sort of qualifying statement such as\n",

      "Similar opportunities to “collude” arise in many betting games. For example, con-sider the typical weekly football betting pool, where each participant wagers $10 and the participants that pick the most games correctly split a large pot. The pool seems fair if you think of it as in Figure \n",
      ". But, in fact, if two or more players collude by guessing differently, they can get an “unfair” advantage at your expense!\n",
      "In some cases, the collusion is inadvertent and you can profit from it. For ex-ample, many years ago, a former MIT Professor of Mathematics named Herman Chernoff figured out a way to make money by playing the state lottery. This was surprising since state lotteries typically have very poor expected returns. That’s be-cause the state usually takes a large share of the wagers before distributing the rest of the pot among the winners. Hence, anyone who buys a lottery ticket is expected to lose money. So how did Chernoff find a way to make money? It turned out to be easy!\n",
      "In a typical state lottery,\n",
      "all players pay $1 to play and select 4 numbers from 1 to 36, the state draws 4 numbers from 1 to 36 uniformly at random,\n",
      "the states divides 1/2 of the money collected among the people who guessed correctly and spends the other half redecorating the governor’s residence.\n",
      "This is a lot like the game you played with Nick and Eric, except that there are more players and more choices. Chernoff discovered that a small set of numbers was selected by a large fraction of the population. Apparently many people think the same way; they pick the same numbers not on purpose as in the previous game with Nick and Eric, but based on Manny’s batting average or today’s date.\n",
      "It was as if the players were colluding to lose! If any one of them guessed correctly, then they’d have to split the pot with many other players. By selecting numbers uniformly at random, Chernoff was unlikely to get one of these favored sequences. So if he won, he’d likely get the whole pot! By analyzing actual state lottery data, he determined that he could win an average of 7 cents on the dollar. In other words, his expected return was not $:50 as you might think, but C$:07.\n",
      "Inadvertent collusion often arises in betting pools and is a phenomenon that you can take advantage of. For example, suppose you enter a Super Bowl betting pool where the goal is to get closest to the total number of points scored in the game. Also suppose that the average Super Bowl has a total of 30 point scored and that\n",

In the next section, we give a similar but stronger result known as Chebyshev’s Theorem. The difference between these results is that Markov’s Theorem depends only on the mean of the random variable, whereas Chebyshev’s Theorem makes use of the mean and the variance. Basically, the more you know about a random variable, the better bounds you can derive on the probability that it deviates from its mean.\n",

      "The idea behind Markov’s Theorem can be explained with a simple example involv-ing intelligence quotients, or IQs. This quantity was devised so that the average IQ measurement would be 100. From this fact alone we can conclude that at most 1/3 the population can have an IQ of 300 or more, because if more than a third had an IQ of at least 300, then the average IQ would have to be more than .1=3/300 D 100, contradicting the fact that the average is 100. So the probability that a randomly chosen person has an IQ of 300 or more is at most 1/3. Of course this is not a very strong conclusion since no IQ over 200 has ever been recorded.\n",
      "By the same logic, we can also conclude that at most 2/3 of the population can have an IQ of 150 or more. IQ’s over 150 have certainly been recorded, although a much smaller fraction than 2/3 of the population actually has an IQ that high.\n",
      "Although these conclusions about IQ are weak, they are actually the strongest general conclusions that can be reached about a random variable using only the fact that it is nonnegative and its mean is 100. For example, if we choose a random variable equal to 300 with probability 1/3, and 0 with probability 2/3, then its mean is 100, and the probability of a value of 300 or more really is 1/3. So we can’t hope to get a better upper bound based solely on this limited amount of information.\n",

Each post is as-signed to one of m computers for processing, and each computer works sequen-tially through its assigned tasks. Processing an average post takes a computer 1=4 second. Some posts, such as pointless grammar critiques and snide witticisms, are easier. But the most protracted harangues require 1 full second.\n",
      "Balancing the work load across the m computers is vital; if any computer is as-signed more than 10 minutes of work in a 10-minute interval, then that computer is overloaded and system performance suffers. That would be bad, because Fussbook users are not a tolerant bunch.\n",
      "An early idea was to assign each computer an alphabetic range of forum topics. (“That oughta work!”, one programmer said.) But after the computer handling the “privacy” and “preferred text editor” threads melted, the drawback of an ad hoc approach was clear: there are no guarantees.\n",

Such problems are hard to solve exactly, though approximation algorithms can come close. But in this case, task lengths are not known in advance, which is typical for workload problems in the real world.\n",

      "One day, they came up with a whopper. Suppose they bought a collection of 1000 (say) subprime mortgage loans from all around the country and packaged them up into a single entity called a bond. A mortgage loan is a loan to a homeowner using the house as collateral; if the homeowner stops paying on the loan (in which case the loan is said to be in default), then the owner of the loan takes ownership of the house. A mortgage loan is classified as subprime if the homeowner does not have a very good credit history. Subprime loans are considered to be more risky than prime loans since they are more likely to default. Defaults are bad for everyone; the homeowner loses the home and the loan owner gets stuck trying to sell the house, which can take years and often results in very high losses.\n",
      "Of course, a bond consisting of 1000 subprime loans doesn’t sound very appeal-ing to investors, so to dress it up, Golden sells the bond in tranches. The idea behind the tranches is to provide a way to assign losses from defaults. In a typical scenario, there would be 10 tranches and they are prioritized from 1 to 10. The defaults are assessed against the lowest tranches first. For example, suppose that there were 150 defaults in the collection of 1000 loans (an impossibly high number of defaults according to Golden). Then the lowest tranche would absorb the first 100 defaults (effectively wiping them out since all 100 of “their” loans would be in default) and the second-lowest tranche would be assigned the next 50 defaults, (wiping out half of their investment). The remaining 8 tranches would be doing great—none of “their” loans would be in default.\n",
      "Because they are taking on more risk, the lower tranches would get more of the interest payments. The top tranche would get the lowest rate of return and would also be the safest. The lowest tranche would get the most interest, but also be the most exposed.\n",
      "But how much should you pay for a tranche? Suppose the probability that any given loan defaults in a year is 1%. In other words, suppose you expect 10 of the 1000 loans to default in each year. If the defaults are independent, then we can use the Chernoff bound to conclude that the chances of more than 100 defaults (10%) in the 1000-loan collection is exceedingly tiny. This means that every tranche but the lowest is essentially risk-free. That is excellent news for Golden since they can buy 1000 cheap\n",
      "subprime loans and then sell the top 9 tranches at premium rates, thereby making a large and instant profit on 900 of the 1000 loans. It is like turning a bunch of junk into a bunch of gold with a little junk left over.\n",
      "There remains the problem of the lowest tranche, which is expected to have 10 defaults in a pool of 100 loans for a default rate of 10%. This isn’t so good\n",
      "\n",
      "They are subprime loans after all.\n",

      "so the first thing to do is to give the tranche a better sounding name than “lowest tranche.” “Mezzanine” tranche sounds much less ominous and so that is what they used.\n",
      "By the Chernoff bound, the default rate in the Mezzanine tranche is very un-likely to be much greater than 10%, and so the risk of owning this tranche can be addressed in part by increasing the interest payments for the tranche by 10%. But Golden had an even better idea (whopper number two)—rather than pay the ex-tra 10%, why not collect together a bunch of mezzanine tranches from a bunch of bonds and then package them together into a “super bond” and then create tranches in the super-bond? The technical name for such a super bond is a collateralized debt obligation or CDO. This way, 90% of the mezzanine tranches instantly be-came essentially “risk-free,” or so Golden claimed as they were marketing them.\n",
      "The only problem now is getting the pension funds and other big investors to buy the CDOs at the same price as if they were AAA-rated “risk-free” bonds. This was a little tricky because 1) it was virtually impossible for the buyer to figure out exactly what loans they were effectively buying since they were buying a tranche of a collection of tranches, and 2) if you could ever figure out what it was, you would discover that it was the junk of the junk when it comes to loans.\n",
      "The solution was to enlist the help of the big bond-rating agencies: Substandard and Prevaricators (S&P) and Mopey’s. If Golden could get AAA ratings\n",
      "on their tranches, then the pension funds and other big investors would buy them at premium rates.\n",
      "It turned out to be easier than you might think (or hope) to convince S&P and Mopey’s to give high ratings to the CDO tranches. After all, the ratings agencies are trying to make money too and they make money by rating bonds. And Golden was only going to pay them if their bonds and CDOs got good ratings. And, since defaults were assumed to be essentially independent, there was a good argument as to why all but the mezzanine tranche of a bond or CDO would be essentially risk-free.\n",
      "So the stage is set for Golden to make a bundle of money. Cheap junk loans come in the back door and exit as expensive AAA-rated bonds and CDOs out the front door. The remaining challenge is to ramp up the new money-making machine. That\n",

      "AAA ratings are the best you can get and are supposed to imply that there is virtually no chance of default.\n",
      "The logic gets a little fuzzy when you keep slicing and dicing the tranches—after a few iterations, you should be able to conclude that the mezzanine tranche of a CDO is sure to have 100% defaults, but it required effort to see what was going on under the covers and effort costs money, and so the ratings agencies considered the risk of the mezzanine tranche of one CDO to be the same as the mezzanine tranche of any other, even though they could have wildly different probabilities of sustaining large numbers of defaults.\n",

Once home values stop rising, or a recession hits, or it comes time for Joe to refinance, defaults will occur at much higher rates than projected and the CDOs and many tranches of the underlying bonds will become worthless.

That’s where the world’s largest insurance company, Awful Insurance Group (AIG), enters the fray. AIG sells insurance on just about anything and they, too, are looking for new ways to make money, so why not sell insurance on CDO defaults?\n",
      "Golden has a new business! They buy the CDO insurance from AIG for an astonishingly low price (about $2 annually for every $1000 of CDO value) and sell it to the hedge funds for a much higher price (about $20 annually for every $1000 of CDO value). If a CDO sustains defaults, then AIG needs to pay the value of the CDO ($1000 in this hypothetical example) to the hedge funds who own the insurance. Until that time, the hedge funds are paying the annual fee for the insurance, 90% of which is pocketed by Golden. This is a great business; Golden pockets 90% of the money and AIG takes all the risk. The only risk that Golden has is if AIG goes down, but AIG is “too big to fail. . . . ”\n",
      "Golden’s new credit default swap business is even better than the CDO business. The only trouble now is that there are only so many Joes out there who can take out subprime loans. This means that there is a hard limit on how many billions Golden can make. This challenge led to whopper number four.\n",
      "If the hedge funds want to buy insurance and AIG wants to sell it, who really cares if there is only one insurance policy per loan or CDO? Indeed, why not just sell lots of credit default swaps on the same set of junk CDOs? This way, the profits could be unlimited! And so it went. “Synthetic” CDOs were created and soon the “insurance” quickly turned into a very high-stakes (and very stupid, at least for AIG) bet. The odds were weighted heavily in favor of the folks who did their math homework (the hedge funds); the hedge funds had figured out that the failure of the CDOs was a virtual certainty, whereas AIG believed that failure was virtually impossible.\n",
      "Of course, we all know how the story ends. The holders of the CDOs and sub-prime debt and the sellers of insurance got wiped out, losing hundreds of billions of dollars. Since many of these folks were deemed by the Government as “too big to fail,” they were bailed out using nearly a trillion dollars of taxpayer money. The executives who presided over the disaster were given huge bonuses because, well, that’s how it works for executives in the land far, far away. The story also ends well for the hedge funds that bought the insurance—they made many, many billions of dollars.\n",

The walk is said to be unbiased if the value is equally likely to move up or down. If the walk ends when a certain value is reached, then that value is called a boundary condition or absorbing barrier. For example, the Cliff of Doom is a boundary condition in the example above.\n",

For example, the value is often regarded as the position of a drunkard who randomly staggers left, staggers right, or just wobbles in place during each time step.

       "' 20.3.2 There Is No Escape Let’s try to verify this intuition. Suppose that you sit at position k ⁄ 0. At some point, the broccoli is going to end up in the hands of one of your neighbors. This has to happen eventually; the game can’t end until at least one of them touches it. Let’s say that person k 1 gets the broccoli first. Now let’s cut the circle between yourself and your other neighbor, person k C 1: k\\t.k\\t1/\\t: : :\\t3\\t2\\t1\\t0\\tn\\t.n\\t1/\\t: : :\\t.k C 1/: B There are two possibilities. If the broccoli reaches you before it reaches person k C 1, then you lose. But if the broccoli reaches person k C 1 before it reaches you, then every other person has touched the broccoli and you win. So we need to compute the probability that the broccoli hops n 1 people to the right before it takes 1 hop to the left. This will be the probability that you win. But this is just the flea problem all over again. From the analysis in Section  So our intuition was completely wrong (again)! It doesn’t matter where you sit. Being close to the broccoli or far away at the start makes no difference; there is no escape—you still get the broccoli last with probability 1=n. Enough with the bad news: Stencil’s doomed, you go home broke from the casino, and you can’t escape the broccoli. Let’s see how to use probability to make some money.
